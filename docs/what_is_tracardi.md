# What is Tracardi

Tracardi is ann open-source system that supports customer engagement and enhances the consumer experience. Tracardi is
not a marketing automation system, although it does have some elements of marketing automation [^1]. Tracardi is
intended for anyone who carries out some type of customer interaction, be it through sales or service delivery.

# How tracardi performs its services

Tracardi collects data from the so-called customer journeys[^2]. The data is in the form of events[^3] that have context
and event data. Each event is assigned to a profile that is maintained throughout the period of interaction with the
customer, incl. using a website or mobile application.

Customer journey[^2] data is aggregated in the profile[^4]. The method of attaching data to the profile is defined in the
graphical editor, which is part of the Tracardi system.

Customer data is aggregated in the profile. The method of attaching data to the profile is defined in the graphical
editor, which is part of the Tracardi system.

By integrating Tracardi with your system, e.g. SaaS service, you can use Tracardi to track each customer's interaction
with the company. The information you collect may cover various consumer decisions, including

* If the customer decides to subscribe to your services;
* Under what circumstances (the so-called event context);
* Whether the customer is satisfied with your service or wants to cancel it;

# Data processing and decision-making

The scope of data processing depends on what the administrator creates in the graphical data editor. Tracardi can
connect to other systems, such as AI, to analyze, for example, whether a customer who left a product description is
satisfied with it or not (sentiment analysis). In this way, the controller decides how the data is processed and whether
we need to contact the customer or provide any information in the end user interface.

# Interaction with customers

Contact with the customer depends on the consents granted. Tracardi stores the consent for direct contact and, depending
on the consent granted, you can, for example, send the customer a confirmation of the transaction by e-mail or, only
display it on the website.

Tracardi can increase customer engagement by asking questions about transaction satisfaction. For this
purpose, Tracardi uses micro applications (micro frontends) that can be conditionally attached to a regular website,
depending on what has been defined in the workflow editor. These types of applications appear as pop-ups on the website
and can send subsequent events to the system with customer answers.

Tracardi also integrates other contact methods, such as sending SMS notifications, e-mails or contact via external
systems.

A customer journey is an entire experience a customer has while communicating with a brand. It considers the complete
interaction roadmap from brand discovery to purchasing and beyond. The focus isn't on transactions, but rather how the
customer feels after interactions with the brand.

In programming and software design, an event is an action or occurrence recognized by software, often originating
asynchronously from the external environment, that may be handled by the software. Computer events can be generated or
triggered by the system, by the user, or in other ways.

[^4]:
A user profile is a collection of settings and information associated with a user. It can be defined as the explicit
digital representation of the identity of the user with respect to the operating environment, which could be operating
systems, software applications or websites. The user profile helps in associating characteristics with a user and helps
in ascertaining the interactive behavior of the user along with preferences.
