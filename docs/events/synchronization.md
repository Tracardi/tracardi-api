# Profile Synchronization in Data Management

Profile synchronization plays a crucial role in data management, especially in systems handling extensive customer data,
such as customer data platforms. This process is essential for managing a large number of events and actions linked to
individual customer profiles. Synchronization ensures the accuracy, consistency, and timeliness of data, and maintains
the correct order of actions and processes.

Consider an online retailer using a customer data platform like Tracardi. This retailer monitors various
customer-related activities, including product searches, purchases, and interactions with customer service. The
platform, Tracardi, might be receiving numerous events every second, pertaining to various customer profiles.

To process these events effectively, Tracardi employs profile synchronization. This approach involves processing events
for each customer profile sequentially. Even if multiple events for a single customer arrive simultaneously, they are
processed one after the other. This method guarantees that the data for each customer remains accurate and current,
ensuring that all actions and processes are executed correctly.

For instance, consider a scenario where two messages need to be sent, with the second message contingent on the outcome
of the first. The system will wait for the completion of the first event before initiating the second message. This
sequential processing is fundamental to maintaining data integrity.

Without profile synchronization, there's a risk of processing events for different customer profiles in a disordered
manner, potentially leading to data inconsistencies and errors.
