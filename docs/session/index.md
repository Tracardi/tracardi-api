# Session

A session refers to a specific period of time during which a user interacts with a website or application. This concept
is essential for analyzing user engagement, understanding user journeys, and providing personalized experiences.

When a user visits a website or application integrated with Tracardi, a unique session ID is assigned to them. This ID
is typically stored in a cookie on the user's device, or in device memory. The session ID enables Tracardi to recognize
and associate the user's actions and events within a specific session.

The Tracardi system calculates visits based on the continuity of the session ID. If the session ID remains the same, it
suggests that the user is still actively engaging with the website or application. Consequently, Tracardi considers this
as part of the same visit. However, if the user closes their browser, or when the session expires, the session ID gets
deleted. A new session begins when the user revisits the site.

Through tracking sessions, Tracardi can offer insights into various aspects of user behavior. For instance, it can
calculate session duration, page views per session, entry and exit points, and conversion rates.

For example, suppose there is a website integrated with Tracardi. When a user visits this site, a session begins, and
the user gets a unique session ID, stored in a cookie on their device. The activities that the user conducts on the
website, like viewing different pages, adding items to the cart, purchasing an item, etc., are tracked under this
session ID. If the user closes the site and comes back later, a new session with a new ID starts.

This session tracking aids in understanding the user behavior during each visit, providing a personalized user
experience, and so forth.
