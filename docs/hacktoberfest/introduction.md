Hello üëã and welcome to the HACKTOBERFEST 2023.

We're really excited to be a part of this fantastic event with our project, Tracardi!
Tracardi is a customer data platform that's open-source and has been in active development for the past two years. Our
mission is to assist businesses in tailoring their sales to meet customer needs better through automation. To kick off
Hacktoberfest, we've created an introductory video to help you get acquainted with us.
