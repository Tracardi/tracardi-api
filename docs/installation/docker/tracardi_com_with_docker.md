# Docker-based Tracardi Installation

Make sure you have docker installed on your system.

## Tracardi API Version

!!! Note

    The following instalation description use the latest tracardi container version. If you would like to install stable version 
    of the system, what we strongly recommend, please add to `tracard/com-tracardi-api` a tag with version, e.g `tracardi/com-tracardi-api:0.8.1`. 
    The same applies to `tracardi/tracardi-gui`. Keep the version of API and GUI the same. 

## Access to commercial dockers

When you buy a Tracardi license, you'll get a DockerHub token. This token lets you download the commercial dockers.

Tracardi GUI looks the same in both the open-source and commercial versions. The only difference is the API.

### Login to Docker Hub

```bash
docker login -u tracari -p <token>
```

### Set the LICENSE

Then create a file .env-docker and paste the LICENSE in it:

```
API_LICENSE="paste license here"
```

When running linux:

```
set -a
source .env-docker
```

### Start Tracardi API

Pull and run Tracardi backend.

```bash
docker run -p 8686:80 -e ELASTIC_HOST=http://<your-elastic-ip>:9200 -e REDIS_HOST=redis://<your-redis-ip>:6379 tracardi/com-tracardi-api:<last-version> #(1)
```

1. Replace <your-elastic-ip> with your elastic IP. Do the same with <your-redis-ip>. Replace <last-version> with the latest version. Do not use latest.

Tracardi must connect to elasticsearch. To do that you have to set ELASTIC_HOST variable to reference your elasticsearch
instance.

!!! Warning "Waiting for application startup"

    Notice that when type `http://localhost:9200` you try to connect to Elastic on localhost. This means that you're
    connecting to the docker itself as localhost means local in docker. Obviously elastic is not there, so Tracardi will
    never connect. Pass external ip for elastic. This may be your laptop IP if you are running Tracardi locally.

    For more elasticseach connection types, e.g. via HTTP see [advanced elasticsearch connection](../../configuration/elasticsearch/elastic_https.md).
