# Force segmentation

This plugin is designed to ensure that a profile is marked for segmentation at the end of a workflow. It is particularly
useful for cases where the segmentation process needs to be explicitly invoked, ensuring that profiles are categorized
based on predefined conditions after the workflow execution.

# Version

0.6.0.1

## Description

The Force Segmentation plugin plays a critical role in the post-event segmentation process by marking a profile for
segmentation once a workflow concludes. This action is typically automatic, triggered by updates to a profile during the
workflow. However, there are scenarios where manual invocation of segmentation is necessary or desired. This plugin
provides the functionality to do so, ensuring that profiles are segmented according to the latest data and interactions
recorded during the workflow. Upon execution, if the profile exists, it is marked for segmentation, and its segmentation
timestamp is updated. If no profile is found, the plugin issues a warning or error message based on the context (e.g.,
profile-less events or missing profiles).

## Inputs and Outputs

### Inputs:

- **payload**: The plugin can process any input payload, which remains unaltered through its operation.

### Outputs:

- **payload**: Outputs the original payload, indicating that the plugin's primary function does not modify the data flow
  but affects the profile's state.

## Configuration

This plugin does not require any configuration. It is designed to operate without needing any input parameters, making
it straightforward to incorporate into any workflow where manual segmentation triggering is needed.

## Required resources

This plugin does not require external resources to be configured.

## Event prerequisites

The Force Segmentation plugin is compatible with all types of events. It functions independently of the event's nature,
focusing solely on the profile segmentation process.

## Errors

There are no specific errors generated by the plugin itself during its operation. However, it provides feedback through
console warnings or errors in scenarios where segmentation cannot be performed, such as when handling profile-less
events or when a profile is absent.

- **Warning**: "Can not segment profile when processing profile less events." This warning occurs if the event being
  processed does not have an associated profile.
- **Error**: "Can not segment profile. Profile is empty." This error is logged when the profile expected to be segmented
  is missing or empty.

By using the Force Segmentation plugin, workflows can ensure that profiles are always segmented according to the latest
interactions and data, even when manual intervention is required to trigger the segmentation process. This capability
ensures that profiles are accurately categorized for targeted actions and analysis.
