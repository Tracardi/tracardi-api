# Delete segment from profile

This action allows you to delete a segment from a profile. When triggered, the specified segment will be removed from
the profile.

To ensure that the changes made to the profile are saved, a __profile update__ is necessary. This means that after the
segment is removed, you need to perform a profile update to finalize the changes and ensure they are reflected in the
updated profile.
