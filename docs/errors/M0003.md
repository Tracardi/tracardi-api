# ERROR: Could not find multi indices for X

Code: M0002
Origin: migration
Level: ERROR

## Description:

This error occurs when the migration script expects to find indices matching a specific pattern (multi indices) for
migration purposes but fails to locate them. It suggests that the anticipated partitioned or time-series indices do not
exist or do not follow the expected naming convention.

## Solution

Ensure that the indices intended for migration exist and match the expected naming convention or pattern. Verify the
Elasticsearch index patterns and adjust the migration script or Elasticsearch indices as necessary to align with the
expected multi-index patterns.
