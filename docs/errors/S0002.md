# WARNING: Entity X converts to index-less storage record.

Code: S0002
Origin: storage
Level: WARNING

## Description:

This warning is issued when an entity is converted into a storage record without specifying an index. This scenario is
considered critical because it may lead to the entity being stored without proper index association, complicating data
retrieval and organization. The warning suggests that the system might be attempting to handle an entity in a way that
bypasses the usual indexing process, which could result in inefficiencies or data loss. 

## Solution

Report this warning to the vendor. Document the error for easy fixing.
