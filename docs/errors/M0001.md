# WARNING: Can't find the index X. Migration for this index will be stopped.

Code: M0001
Origin: migration
Level: WARNING

## Description:

This warning is logged when a specified index to migrate from does not exist in the Elasticsearch database. It means the
migration script identified an index that should be migrated but could not find it in the database, leading to the
cessation of migration activities for that specific index.

## Solution

Verify the existence of the index specified by `schema.copy_index.from_index` in the Elasticsearch database. Ensure that
the index name is correct and exists before attempting the migration again. If the index is not needed or the reference
is incorrect, update the migration script to exclude this index or correct the index name.
