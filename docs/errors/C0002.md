# WARNING: No MULTI_TENANT_MANAGER_API_KEY set for MULTI_TENANT mode. Either set the MULTI_TENANT_MANAGER_API_KEY or set MULTI_TENANT to "no"

Code: C0002
Origin: Configuration
Level: WARNING

## Description:

This warning is issued when the application is in MULTI_TENANT mode (`MULTI_TENANT` is "yes"), but
the `MULTI_TENANT_MANAGER_API_KEY` is not provided. The API key is essential for authenticating requests to the
multi-tenant manager.

## Solution

Provide a valid `MULTI_TENANT_MANAGER_API_KEY` when MULTI_TENANT mode is enabled, or set `MULTI_TENANT` to "no" if not
operating in multi-tenant mode.
