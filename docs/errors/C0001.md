# WARNING: No MULTI_TENANT_MANAGER_URL set for MULTI_TENANT mode. Either set the MULTI_TENANT_MANAGER_URL or set MULTI_TENANT to "no"

Code: C0001
Origin: Configuration
Level: WARNING

## Description:

This warning is logged if the system is configured to operate in MULTI_TENANT mode (`MULTI_TENANT` is set to "yes"), but
the `MULTI_TENANT_MANAGER_URL` is not specified. This configuration is necessary for managing multiple tenants within
the system.

## Solution

Ensure that `MULTI_TENANT_MANAGER_URL` is set to a valid URL when `MULTI_TENANT` mode is enabled, or
disable `MULTI_TENANT` mode by setting it to "no" if multi-tenancy is not required.
