# ERROR: Installed system version is X for tenant A, but migration script is for version Z for tenant B.

Code: M0002
Origin: migration
Level: ERROR

## Description:

This error is logged when there is a mismatch between the installed system version (or tenant) and the version (or
tenant) for which the migration script is intended. It indicates that the migration cannot proceed because the target
version or tenant does not match the system's current configuration.

## Solution

Ensure that the system version and tenant match the intended target version and tenant specified in the migration
script. Update the system or select the appropriate migration script that matches the system's current version and
tenant.
