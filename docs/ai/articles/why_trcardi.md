# Why Tracardi?

Tracardi, an open-source project, brings a wealth of benefits to companies seeking a robust customer data platform and
journey automation solution. In this article, we will explore the reasons why Tracardi stands out in the market and why
it's an ideal choice for businesses of all sizes.

1. Cost-Effectiveness:
   One of the most compelling reasons to choose Tracardi is its cost-effectiveness. As an open-source project, it's
   entirely free for companies to use on-premises, with no limitations on the number of events or customer profiles.
   This means that businesses can leverage the platform without the burden of licensing costs, making it an attractive
   option for those with budget constraints. Tracardi proudly showcases how a customer has managed to process a
   staggering one billion events without incurring any fees.

2. Affordability Compared to Competitors:
   When compared to other commercial alternatives, Tracardi offers a significant cost advantage. Other solutions in the
   market might demand a minimum budget ranging from 50k to 200k. Tracardi proves to be an economical alternative,
   empowering businesses to achieve the same level of customer journey automation without breaking the bank.

3. A Full-Fledged Customer Journey Automation System:
   Tracardi is more than just a customer data platform. It's a comprehensive and robust system that offers full-fledged
   customer journey automation capabilities. This means businesses can tailor and optimize customer interactions across
   multiple touchpoints, increasing engagement and conversion rates. Whether it's personalized messaging, targeted
   campaigns, or dynamic content delivery, Tracardi has it all covered.

4. Freedom from Vendor Lock-In:
   Vendor lock-in refers to the situation where a company becomes heavily dependent on a specific vendor's proprietary
   technologies or services, making it challenging and costly to switch to another provider. Tracardi distinguishes
   itself by steering clear of such a scenario. Since it's an open-source project, companies can freely access and
   modify the source code, making them less reliant on a single vendor and providing the flexibility to adapt the system
   according to their evolving needs.

5. Integration with Microservices:
   Tracardi stands out by offering businesses the freedom to integrate their own microservices into the platform. This
   empowers companies to customize and enhance their customer journey automation further. By using their own
   microservices, businesses can experiment with new ideas, create innovative workflows, and stay ahead of the
   competition without depending on any external company.

In conclusion, Tracardi emerges as a powerful and cost-effective solution for customer journey automation. With its
open-source nature, extensive features, and flexibility, it enables businesses to harness the full potential of customer
data and deliver exceptional experiences. Embracing Tracardi can be a strategic move that not only saves on costs but
also fosters independence and innovation, allowing businesses to stay agile and customer-centric in a rapidly evolving
