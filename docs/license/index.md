# Tracardi licensing

Tracardi Licensing Options:

Tracardi offers users two distinctive licensing options to cater to their specific needs:

1. [Open Source License](os_license.md):
   Under the Open Source license, Tracardi provides users with the liberty to access, modify, and distribute the
   software's source code openly. This license is based on the MIT license with the inclusion of the Common Clause,
   ensuring that the software remains accessible while still protecting its commercial use.

2. [Standard Commercial License](com_license.md):
   In addition to the Open Source license, Tracardi also offers a Standard Commercial License, which is ideal for
   businesses and organizations seeking enhanced features and greater freedom of use. With this license, commercial
   entities can make full use of Tracardi's features and functionalities for their commercial projects.

It's important to note that both licenses are granted to a single customer, allowing them to choose the license that
best suits their requirements and intended usage of the Tracardi software.
