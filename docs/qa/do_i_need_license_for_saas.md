# Do I need a commercial license to host Tracardi as SaaS?

Yes, to host Tracardi as a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform and offer it to customers for sale, you will require a
commercial license. This license allows you to go beyond in-house use and use Tracardi for commercial purposes, such as
offering it as a service to external customers.
