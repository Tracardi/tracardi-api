# I have error No plugin for id xxx. What could be a reason for this?

This could happen when after migration new system does not have installed some plugins. To resolve this issue fgo to
Resources/extensions and install the missing plugin. Sometimes you also need to click button plugins in the workflow to
reinstall missing plugins.
