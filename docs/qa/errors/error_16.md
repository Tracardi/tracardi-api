# I have an error when executing report

The error you're encountering during report execution is likely linked to the query specified in your reports. Ensure
that your query is compatible with Elasticsearch by testing it directly in Elasticsearch. For assistance, consult the
Elasticsearch documentation to understand how queries should be structured. Additionally, be aware that injected data
might sometimes interfere with the query's integrity, so it's important to check for any issues caused by such data.
