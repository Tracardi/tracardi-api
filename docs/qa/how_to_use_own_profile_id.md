# How to use own profile id?

Setting up your own profile ID in Tracardi involves the following steps:

1. Navigate to the 'Inbound Traffic' section.
2. Select the source from which you are collecting data.
3. Click on the 'Edit' option for that source.
4. Toggle the switch labeled 'Allow static, remotely defined profile ID.'

Enabling this feature allows you to utilize profile IDs that were not generated by Tracardi. The provided profile ID
will be used to create a profile that does not already exist. It's important to be aware that using this feature can
introduce security risks. Therefore, ensure that your custom profile ID is not numeric but rather a UUID4, making it
difficult to guess.
