# Where can I find AD ACCOUNT ID.

To obtain your Facebook Ad Account ID, follow these steps:

1. **Go to Facebook Ads Manager:**
    - Navigate to the [Facebook Ads Manager](https://www.facebook.com/ads/manager).
    - Log in with your Facebook account that is associated with your advertising account.

2. **Find Your Ad Account ID:**
    - Once you're in the Ads Manager, your Ad Account ID can typically be found in the top left corner of the page.
    - It usually appears as a series of numbers, sometimes preceded by 'act_' (e.g., '123456789012345').
    - Alternatively click `Account Overview`, where you should be abel to see AD ACCOUNT ID.

3. **If You Have Multiple Ad Accounts:**
    - If you manage multiple ad accounts, you can find all of them listed under the “Accounts” section in the Ads
      Manager.
    - Select the specific ad account you want to use, and its ID will be displayed.

Remember, you need to have administrative access to the ad account to use it with the Facebook SDK. If you're part of a
team or company, ensure that the account's admin has granted you the necessary permissions.
