# How tracardi tracks customers?

Tracardi tracks customers by collecting and unifying data from various sources, including:

* **Websites:** Tracardi can track customer behavior on websites using cookies and other tracking technologies. This
  data can include the pages a customer visited, the products they viewed, and the actions they took.
* **Mobile apps:** Tracardi can track customer behavior in mobile apps using SDKs. This data can include the screens a
  customer viewed, the actions they took, and their location.
* **Social media:** Tracardi can track customer interactions on social media platforms using APIs. This data can include
  the posts a customer liked, the comments they made, and the groups they joined.
* **Email:** Tracardi can track customer interactions with email campaigns using email tracking pixels. This data can
  include whether a customer opened an email, clicked on a link, or unsubscribed from a list.

Once Tracardi has collected data from these sources, it unifies the data into a single customer profile. This profile
includes all of the information that Tracardi knows about a particular customer, such as their name, email address,
phone number, purchase history, and interests.

Tracardi uses this customer data to track customers in several ways:

* **Customer journey tracking:** Tracardi can track the customer journey across different channels, such as websites,
  mobile apps, and social media. This allows businesses to see how customers interact with their brand and identify
  opportunities to improve the customer experience.
* **Customer segmentation:** Tracardi can segment customers into groups based on their demographics, interests, and
  behavior. This allows businesses to target their marketing campaigns more effectively.
* **Customer attribution:** Tracardi can attribute sales to different marketing channels, such as email, social media,
  and paid advertising. This allows businesses to see which marketing channels are most effective and allocate their
  marketing budget accordingly.

Tracardi can also be used to track customers offline, such as when they visit a physical store or make a purchase over
the phone. This can be done by linking customer IDs to offline data, such as purchase receipts or loyalty card numbers.

By tracking customers, businesses can gain a deeper understanding of their customers' needs and wants. This information
can be used to improve customer service, develop new products and services, and create more effective marketing
campaigns.
