# What is event context?

Event context refers to additional information or data that provides a broader context for an event. It includes
pertinent details that help to better understand the circumstances surrounding the event. The specific content of event
context can vary depending on the nature of the event and the requirements of the system or application.

Event context serves to enrich the event data with supplementary metadata that offers a wider perspective on the event's
occurrence. This additional data can take the form of contextual tags, event categories, or any custom contextual
information specific to the application or system. It allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the event's
significance and its relationship to other events or processes within the system.

In essence, event context provides background information that gives meaning and relevance to the event, facilitating
better analysis, tracking, and decision-making within the system or application.
