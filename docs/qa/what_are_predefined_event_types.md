# What are build-in event types?


Predefined event types in Tracardi are built-in event types that come with default properties. These event types are
designed to track the customer journey on websites or applications. When these internal event types are used, Tracardi
automatically detects them and populates the profile and session with relevant data.

Using predefined event types streamlines the use of Tracardi and simplifies the process of data collection and analysis.
The default properties of these event types eliminate the need for manual copying. They include information such as the
event type, event properties (characteristics or attributes of the event), and contextual data that provides additional
details about the event.

Some examples of predefined event types in Tracardi include:

* Page View: Triggered when a customer visits a new page on the website or application. It captures the URL of the page and the time of the visit.
* Search: Triggered when a customer performs a search on the website or application. It captures the search query and the category of the search.
* Signup: Triggered when a customer signs up for an account. It captures the customer's first name, last name, email address, and login information.
* Identification: Triggered when a customer logs into their account. It captures the customer's login information.
* Purchase Order: Triggered when a customer makes a purchase. It captures the details of the purchase, such as the product ID, name, price, and quantity.
* Cart Update: Triggered when a customer adds or removes items from their shopping cart. It captures the details of the update, including the product ID, name, price, and quantity.

Using these predefined event types helps in understanding customer behavior and preferences, allowing for better website
or application optimization for improved engagement and conversions.
