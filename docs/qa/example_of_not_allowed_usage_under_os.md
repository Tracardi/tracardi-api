# Examples of what is and isn't allowed under the Common Clause license ?

**Allowed under the Common Clause License**:
The Common Clause license allows you to use Tracardi for your company's internal needs or business purposes. It means you
can use Tracardi within your organization to manage data or for other internal tasks. However, you cannot use Tracardi
to create and sell products, services, or modules that heavily rely on Tracardi's main features. In simple terms, you
can use Tracardi for your own business, but you can't make money by selling Tracardi or products built mainly using
Tracardi.

**Allowed under the Common Clause License**:
Some examples include:

- Using Tracardi within your organization to analyze and manage customer data.
- Implementing Tracardi for internal data tracking and analytics purposes.
- Customizing Tracardi for internal use without offering it as a commercial product.

**Not Allowed under the Common Clause License**:
The Common Clause license prohibits certain commercial uses where the value of a product, service, or module is derived
entirely or significantly from Tracardi's functionality. Here are some examples of what is not allowed:

- White-labeling Tracardi (removing Tracardi's branding) and offering it to customers for monetary gain.
- Hosting Tracardi and charging users for accessing all or some of its features and services.
- Selling a product or service that heavily relies on Tracardi's core functionality to generate value for customers.
