# Can I use API to create profile not tracking script?

Sure. Tracardi is an API first solution so you can find all the APIs at http://localhsot:8686/docs. Here is the
docs on how to [use /track API](../integration/api/api-integration.md).

Tracardi is designed to gather data from multiple sources using various methods. While the default method is through a
REST API, its capabilities can be expanded by adding bridges to collect data from queues such as RabbitMQ, Kafka, MQTT,
Pulsar, as well as from email accounts, databases, and more.
