# Will I be vendor locked if I use Tracardi?

Tracardi tries hard not to vendor lock its customers. They provide API integration, allowing you to create adapters and
decouple from Tracardi in the future if needed. Tracardi does not host your data, so there is no risk of data loss when
the agreement ends. Tracardi's flexibility allows you to add custom code to the code base, providing additional
flexibility to meet your specific needs.
