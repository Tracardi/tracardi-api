# Multi-Tenant Setup in Tracardi

In the context of Tracardi, a multi-tenancy setup refers to a system configuration where a single instance of the
software serves multiple customers or "tenants." Each tenant's data is isolated and kept separate from other tenants,
ensuring privacy and security. However, the software instance and underlying resources, such as CPU, memory, and
storage, are shared between all tenants.

A multi-tenancy setup allows multiple different users to utilize a single Tracardi system while ensuring that each user
has their own dedicated space for data storage and operations. This segregation of data and operations ensures that
tenants' activities and information remain independent and inaccessible to others, maintaining a high level of data
privacy and security.
