Apache Pulsar is a free, open-source platform for distributed messaging and data streaming. Initially created by Yahoo,
it's now under the Apache Software Foundation. Designed for processing and streaming large amounts of messages, Apache
Pulsar is known for its reliability, scalability, and flexibility.

# Setting Up Resources and Configuration

To establish a connection with Apache Pulsar from Tracardi, you need the Pulsar server's location. The Apache Pulsar
client, which is used for all interactions with Apache Pulsar, requires a __host__ and a __JWT Token__ for API request
authentication. These details, including the __host__ and __token__, are specified during the installation of Apache Pulsar. For
guidance on how to connect to your queue, you should consult the Apache Pulsar documentation or reach out to your devops
team.
