GitHub is an internet hosting service for software development and version control using Git.

# Resource configuration and set-up

To add a GitHub resource, you need to add your PAT (personal access token).

1. `api_url` - usually this does not need changing and can be left at the default value of `https://api.github.com`.

2. `personal_access_token` - this is a personal access token linked to your GitHub account. Refer to the link below for how to generate a PAT.

For more details you can refer to the following help articles:
