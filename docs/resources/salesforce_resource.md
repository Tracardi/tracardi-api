Salesforce is a cloud-based customer relationship management platform and marketing automation system.

# Resource configuration and set-up

To add a salesforce resource, you need to add you client_id, client_secret and subdomain.

1. `client_id` - This is the consumer key of the connected app. To access the consumer key from the App Manager, find the connected app. Then select **View** from dropdown -> **Manage Consumer Details**. You will prompted to verify your identity before accessing the page.

2. `client_secret` - This is the consumer secret of the connected app. To access the consumer secret from the App Manager, find the connected app. Then select **View** from dropdown -> **Manage Consumer Details**. You will prompted to verify your identity before accessing the page.

3. Your salesforce subdomain (also called *MyDomainName*) is the name which you get while setting up the account for your organisation.
