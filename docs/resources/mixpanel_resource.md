# Resource configuration and set-up

In order to enable an integration between Mixpanel and Tracardi you need an API. Mixpanel has developed a number of APIs
for clients to use that provide a substantial amount of added functionality and give clients the means to customize data
analysis. Mixpanel uses Project tokens for API authentication, it is an identification sent along with each piece of
data you send to your project.

To get a Mixpanel project token for accessing the Mixpanel API, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Sign up for a Mixpanel account**: If you don't already have a Mixpanel account, go to the Mixpanel
   website (https://mixpanel.com/) and sign up for a new account.

2. **Log in to your Mixpanel account**: After creating an account, log in using your credentials on the Mixpanel website.

3. **Access your project**: Once you're logged in, you should see your Mixpanel dashboard. If you haven't created a
   project yet, you'll need to create one by clicking on the "Create Project" or "Add New Project" button and following
   the instructions.

4. **Go to Project Settings**: Navigate to the settings or configuration section of your project. This can usually be
   found by clicking on your project name or the gear/settings icon in the dashboard.

5. **API Access**: Look for the "Project Settings". Here, you should find options related to Access Keys.

6. **Project token**: Copy project token.
