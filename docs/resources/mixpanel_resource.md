To view the Project token:

1. In the Mixpanel header bar, click the icon with your initials.
2. Under  “PERSONAL SETTINGS”, click Profile & Preferences.
3. Click Project in the left navigation bar.
4. In "Projects", you see each project in the organization. Each project contains values for its token, API key, and API secret.
