It is a standard \nway to reference data in Tracardi. It is used across many places in Tracardi such as \nplugins, destinations, etc. \n\n## Example of dot notation\n\n```\nevent@properties.name\n```\n\nDot notation is build from *source* and *path to data*. Available sources are:\n\n* profile\n* event\n* payload\n* flow\n* session\n* memory\n\nPath is a string of keys that indicate where the data is placed.\n\nFor example if your profile data looks like this\n\n```json\n{\n   \"key\": {\n        \"data\": \"value\"\n   }\n}\n```\n\nTo access \"value\" your path will need to look like this: *key.data*.\n\nThe full access dot notation is *profile@key.data*.\n\n!!! Warning\n\n    If there is an error in dot notation or it is not in a right format e.g `profile.data.name` instead of \n    `profile@data.name` then the result is the typed value, in this example `profile.data.name`. That means that any \n    value that is not a valid dot notation will be returned as is.\n\n## Path to part of data\n\nThere is also a way to access a part of data. \n\nA path like *profile@key* will return:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"data\": \"value\"\n}\n```\n\nTo access all data from profile type:\n\n```bash\nprofile@... #(1)\n```\n\n1. Return the whole profile object\n\nIf you would like to retrieve a sub-object form some bigger object. For example everything below __key__. (see below).\n\n```json\n{\n   \"key\": {\n        \"data\": \"value\"\n   }\n}\n```\n\nThen you need to use the following dot notation:\n\n```bash\nprofile@key #(1)\n```\n\n1. Return everything below __key__. The result will be ```{\"data\": \"value\"}```\n\n## Path to array items\n\n## Arrays\n\nItems in array can be accessed like this. For the payload data:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"data\": [\"value1\", \"value2\"]\n}\n```\n\naccessor that get `value1` should look like this.\n\n```\npayload@data.0\n```\n\n!!! Tip\n\n    Also objects embeded inside arrays can be retrieved the same way.\n\n\n## Object with spaces in the keys\n\nThere are rare cases when you have an object with the keys that contain spaces.\n\n```json title=\"Example\"\n{\n   \"key\": {\n        \"My key with spaces\": \"value\"\n   }\n}\n```\n\nTo access this data you will need to use the following dot notation:\n\n```bash\nprofile@key[\"My key with spaces\"]\n```\n\n!!! Tip\n\n    Also objects embeded inside arrays can be retrieved the same way. For exampel ``` profile@key.0[\"My key with spaces\"] ```", "hash": "c9edabc5e007d96b6b09701f7d8971b8ac30cfc5"}
