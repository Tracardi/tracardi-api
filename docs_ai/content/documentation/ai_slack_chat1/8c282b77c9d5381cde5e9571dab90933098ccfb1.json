How does Tracardi utilize conditional segmentation in its segmentation algorithms?", "3. How does the workflow segmentation mechanism in Tracardi determine the movement of profiles to specific segments?"], "answer": "# What types of segmentation algorithms are in tracardi?\nTracardi utilizes a combination of conditional segmentation and workflow segmentation mechanisms. The segmentation\nworkflow applies conditions to the data and marks profiles that meet the specified criteria. The workflow segmentation\nprocesses each profile and determines whether it should be moved to a specific segment based on the workflow's logic.\n\nTherefore, the type of segmentation mechanism in Tracardi is a combination of conditional segmentation and workflow\nsegmentation.", "hash": "8c282b77c9d5381cde5e9571dab90933098ccfb1"}
