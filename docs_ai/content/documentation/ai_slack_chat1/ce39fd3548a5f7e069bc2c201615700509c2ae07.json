But then I need to generate the event first so you can do the report, right? I just want to understand how this is achievable.\nThat's correct. To generate the necessary data for the reports and segmentation, you would need to have the events\ncapturing the relevant information. In this case, the events would include details of user transactions and wallet\nadditions. Once the events are recorded, you can create reports that aggregate and summarize the data, allowing you to\nanalyze the transaction and wallet information. The segmentation workflow can then utilize these reports to filter and\nsegment the profiles based on the desired criteria.", "hash": "ce39fd3548a5f7e069bc2c201615700509c2ae07"}
