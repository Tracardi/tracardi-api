In the system, you create a report on those events that aggregates the data and then use this report in the segmentation workflow. Segmentation kicks off every 15 minutes and uses this report to decide whether to add a segment or not.\nThat's a valid process flow. By collecting events with transaction amounts and wallet additions, you have the raw data\nrequired for analysis. Then, you can create reports that aggregate and summarize this data, providing valuable insights\ninto user behavior and spending patterns. The segmentation workflow can utilize these reports periodically (\ne.g., every 15 minutes) to assess whether a profile meets the criteria for inclusion in a specific segment. Based on the\ndefined conditions, the segmentation workflow will determine whether to add the profile to the segment or not.", "hash": "47c7f1ce086c3518d7c6382c76731e24fa069ede"}
