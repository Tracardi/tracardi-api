What are the steps involved in creating a segmentation workflow based on event properties?", "3.

Looks like it is based on event properties. But I'm not sure how we can find the profiles that have X events with a value of property Y.\nTo achieve this use case, you can utilize a combination of segmentation and event properties. You can create a\nsegmentation workflow that filters profiles based on event properties such as transaction amount and wallet addition\namount. By specifying the desired values for X and Y, you can define the criteria for segmenting the users. The\nsegmentation workflow will evaluate the event properties for each profile and include the profiles that meet the\nspecified criteria in the segment.", "hash": "d8c73b167913069837ef72b972ecf22507f0e455"}
