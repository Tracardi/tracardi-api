First, you need to have\nevents that track each transaction, with the transaction amount as a property of the event. Then, you can create a\nreport that aggregates the transaction amounts over a specific period, such as the last 30 days. Once you have the\naggregated data, you can use it in a segmentation workflow to identify the profiles that meet the criteria based on the\naggregated amounts. The segmentation workflow can be scheduled to run periodically, such as every 15 minutes, and it\nwill add the matching profiles to the desired segment. The aggregation is done on the events index, and the system\nconnects the aggregated data to the corresponding profiles for segmentation.\n", "hash": "390556d91b4f6de0abc123a3fc44bb0704dd43b5"}
