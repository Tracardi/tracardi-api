And then the segmentation workflow?\nYes, that's one possible approach. First, you would create reports that aggregate and summarize the event data, allowing\nyou to analyze specific metrics such as transaction amounts and wallet additions. These reports provide valuable\ninsights into user behavior. Then, you can design a segmentation workflow that utilizes these reports as a basis for\nsegmenting the profiles. The segmentation workflow would apply the defined criteria to the aggregated data, resulting in\nthe creation of segments based on the specified conditions.", "hash": "a487b25300566bcc3f6482b9e33ffb1e37797538"}
