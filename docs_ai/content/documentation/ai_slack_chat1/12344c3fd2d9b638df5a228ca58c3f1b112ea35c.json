Let's assume I have an event for every transaction, and the amount of the transaction is a property of the event.\nYes, the use case you described is achievable by leveraging event properties. If you have an event for every\ntransaction, and the transaction amount is a property of the event, you can use that information to filter and segment\nprofiles based on their transaction history and wallet additions. By defining the desired criteria and applying them in\nyour segmentation workflow, you can create segments that meet the specified conditions.", "hash": "12344c3fd2d9b638df5a228ca58c3f1b112ea35c"}
