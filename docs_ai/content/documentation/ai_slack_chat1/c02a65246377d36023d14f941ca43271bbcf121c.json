And then how do we know the profiles that match that criteria?\nTo identify the profiles that match the specified criteria (e.g., users who have transacted worth X USD and added Y USD\nto the wallet), you can use the segmentation workflow.

This way, you can obtain a segment of users who fulfill\nthe required transaction and wallet addition conditions.", "hash": "c02a65246377d36023d14f941ca43271bbcf121c"}
