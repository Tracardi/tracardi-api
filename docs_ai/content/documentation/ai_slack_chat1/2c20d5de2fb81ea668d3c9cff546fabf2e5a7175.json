{"file_name": "docs/ai/slack/chat1.md", "questions": ["- How does the aggregation happen?", "- How is the aggregation connected to the profile?", "- How can you do the aggregation of the amount of events per profile?"], "answer": "# But then my question is, how does the aggregation happen? Because the aggregation should be per profile, and then the profiles that match this will be in the segment. The aggregation part is what confuses me because the aggregation will be done on the events index, but how is this connected to the profile? To do the aggregation of the amount of the events per profile?\nThe aggregation can be done at the profile level by grouping the events associated with each profile. Each event\ncontains information about the transaction amount and other relevant details. By grouping the events per profile, you\ncan calculate the aggregated values, such as the total transaction amount for each profile over a specified period. The\naggregation process connects the events to their corresponding profiles, allowing you to aggregate the event data per\nprofile.", "hash": "2c20d5de2fb81ea668d3c9cff546fabf2e5a7175"}
