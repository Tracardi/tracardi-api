Tracardi offers two types of segmentation: conditional and workflow. Conditional\nsegmentation applies specific conditions to the data and identifies profiles that meet those conditions it does not\ncheck the events. On the other hand, workflow segmentation evaluates each profile and determines whether it should be\nassigned to a particular segment based on the workflow's logic. Workflow logic can aggregate events to retrieve more\ninsights about profile past behaviour.", "hash": "a0a09f3c4f451341145dadd7d264ac528960830d"}
