Twilio is a cloud communications platform\nthat allows you to send SMS messages, make voice calls, and more using their API. Here's how you can obtain\nthe __account_sid__ and __auth_token__:\n\n1. **Sign up for a Twilio account**: If you don't have a Twilio account, you can sign up for a new account on their\n   website at https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio.\n\n2. **Log in to your Twilio account**: After creating an account, log in using your email address and password.\n\n3. **Dashboard**: Once you're logged in, you will be directed to your Twilio dashboard.\n\n4. **Account SID**: On the dashboard page, you will find your __account_sid__ displayed prominently. It is a 34-character\n   string that uniquely identifies your Twilio account. Copy this value; you will need it to authenticate API requests.\n\n5. **Auth Token**: To get your __auth_token__, click on your account name or the three vertical dots at the top right\n   corner of the dashboard, and then click on \"Settings\" or \"Account Settings.\" In the account settings page, you will\n   find your __auth_token__ under the \"API Credentials\" or \"Live Credentials\" section. This token is used to authenticate\n   your API requests along with your __account_sid__.\n\n6. **Store and secure your credentials**: Both the __account_sid__ and __auth_token__ are sensitive and should be kept\n   secure. Do not share them publicly or hardcode them in your application's source code. Use environment variables or\n   configuration files to store them securely.\n", "hash": "a0d24b0482938904e89fa995f6fbacacf6c601e8"}
