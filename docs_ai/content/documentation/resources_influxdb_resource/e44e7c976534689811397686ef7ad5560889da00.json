  "answer": "# Resource configuration and set-up\nIn order to enable an integration between __InfluxDB__ and Tracardi you need an API. The __InfluxDB__ API provides a programmatic \ninterface for all interactions with __InfluxDB__, it uses API tokens to authorize API requests. API tokens ensure secure \ninteraction between __InfluxDB__ and Tracardi. An API token belongs to a specific user and identifies InfluxDB permissions \nwithin the user\u2019s organization.\n\nTo manage InfluxDB API Tokens in the __InfluxDB UI__:\n\n1. Navigate to the API Tokens management page.\n2. In the navigation menu on the left, select Data (Load Data) > Tokens.\n3. Click a token name in the list to view the token and a summary of access permissions.\n\nFor Creating a token in the __InfluxDB UI__:\n\n1. From the API Tokens management page, click __Generate__ and select a token type (Read/Write Token or All Access API\n   Token).\n2. In the window that appears, enter a description for your token in the __Description__ field.<br>\n3. If generating a read/write token:\n   * Search for and select buckets to read from in the Read pane.\n   * Search for and select buckets to write to in the Write pane.\n4. Click __Save__.\n\nIf you need more help with getting your API Token visit: https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2.4/security/tokens/\n"
