You may want to run some data processing in\nthe background and distribute the load to multiple servers.***\n\nFor Extensive Information about RabbitMQ visit : https://www.rabbitmq.com/documentation.html\n\n- _You can create new user for accessing your RabbitMQ broker. Normally port used is 5672 but you can change it in your configuration file._\n\n- _So suppose your IP is 1.1.1.1 and you created user test with password test and you want to access vhost \"dev\" (without quotes) then it will look something like this:\namqp://test:test@1.1.1.1:5672/dev_\n\n- _A virtual host has a name. When an AMQP 0-9-1 client connects to RabbitMQ, it specifies a vhost name to connect to. If authentication succeeds and the username provided was granted permissions to the vhost, connection is established._"}
