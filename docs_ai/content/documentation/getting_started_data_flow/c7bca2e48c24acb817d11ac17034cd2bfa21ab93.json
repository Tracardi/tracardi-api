Example \"Common characteristics of a market segment\"\n\n    Common characteristics of a market segment include interests, lifestyle, age, gender, frequency, etc. Common examples of\n    market segmentation include geographic, demographic, psychographic, and behavioral.\n\n## Merging\n\nProfile merging is the process of finding customer profiles that belong to one person and have been saved as separate\nrecords for various reasons. Tracardi runs profile merging after the workflow ends.\n\n!!! Question \"How the profile can be merged?\"\n\n    In order to combine data into one record, it is necessary to indicate the field containing\n    the value by which the customer data could be combined. This process will start automatically if the workflow has a merge\n    profile action. \n\n---\nSummary\n\nQuestions that this documentation answers:\n\n* What stages does data flow through in Tracardi?\n* How does Tracardi route events to the appropriate workflow?\n* What is the role of segmentation in Tracardi?\n* How does Tracardi handle profile merging?\n* What is event reshaping in Tracardi?\n* How does Tracardi determine which workflow to use when processing an event?\n* How does segmentation in Tracardi differ from traditional market segmentation techniques?\n* Can Tracardi be used to send data to multiple external systems simultaneously? If so, how?\n* How does Tracardi validate event data?\n* What are some examples of tasks that can be performed by actions in Tracardi workflows?\n* How does Tracardi segment profiles?\n* How to merge profiles from different channels?\n"}
