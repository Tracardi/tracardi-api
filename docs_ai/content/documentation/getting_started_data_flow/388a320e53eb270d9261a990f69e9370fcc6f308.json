By creating an event source,\ncreates a token that, when attached to the event data, will allow it to be sent through the above-mentioned endpoints\n\n!!! Tips\n\n    Event sources can be found in Tracardi GUI under Traffic. We have inbound traffic that comes to Tracardi - \n    we call it `event sources`. And there is outboud traffic sometimes called the destination. This is the external\n    system that the profile data can be sent when profile changes.\n    \n## Event data validation\n\nEvent data validation is the process of checking the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of data associated with an event. This may involve verifying that the data meets certain standards or requirements, such as being in the correct format, or containing required fields.\n\nEvent data validation is an important part of ensuring the quality and reliability of data used for analysis and decision-making. By ensuring that the data is accurate and complete, businesses can trust that the insights they derive from the data are reliable and actionable.\n\n## Event collection\n\nEvent collection refers to the process of gathering data about events within Tracardi. \n\n!!! Note \"Example of an event\"\n\n    Event ia data that is described by a type, e.g. a `purchase-order` event may contain data such as __product name__,\n    __quantity__ and __price__. \n\nAll events go to a central database in elasticsearch and can be viewed via the GUI in the `Data` section.\n\nEvents can be saved in the database or only processed. For each new event without an assigned user, Tracardi will create\na new profile and assign upcoming events to it.\n\n![Browsing events](../images/browsing-events.png)\n\n\n## Event routing\n\nTracardi saves the collected event and then looks for the rules that define the workflow to use to process the events. A\nrule is a simple filtering process that checks that an event comes from a defined source and has a defined event type.\nFor example, a simple rule might require a website to be the source of an event and a page-view for the event. Then, if\nan event occurs meets these criteria, the rule will run the defined flow and send the event data.\n\nThe rules connect events of a given type with the indicated workflow.\n\n!!! Warning\n\n    Events that at the time of their registration did not have rules created, i.e. they were not connected to the process\n    that processes them, are not processed. They remain in the `received state`. Tracardi does not currently offer\n    reprocessing of old data. More on events can be found in [Event's core definitions](../events/index.md)\n\n!!! Tip\n\n    You can find more about the technical aspects of collecting events and processing them in \n    [Event tracking](../events/event_tracking.md)\n\n## Processing\n\nTracardi uses workflows to process data.\n\nWorkflow is a graph of actions that will run when an event is matched with workflow. Actions may run one after another\nor in parallel. Workflow is represented as a graph of nodes and connections between them. Actions are assigned to nodes\nin the workflow graph. Actions may perform different tasks such as copying data from the event to profile, save profile,\nquery for additional data, send parts or whole data to another system or emit another event.\n\n![Browsing events](../images/workflow.png)\n\nWhen the workflow ends Tracardi checks if there is a need for profile update, segmentation, and merging.\n\n## Segmentation\n\nSegmentation is a term that refers to aggregating prospective customers into groups or segments with common needs.\nSegmentation enables companies to target different categories of consumers who perceive the full value of certain\nproducts and services differently from one another.\n\nSegmentation in Tracardi is based on a segment logic that is defined in the "}
