Can an event source be configured to store data permanently in Tracardi?", "6. Are there different types of bridges available to collect data from Tracardi?", "7. Is user consent required for collecting and storing data from certain sources in Tracardi?"], "answer": "# What is event source?\nEvent source refers to incoming traffic, which consists of systems that are capable of\nsending data to Tracardi. These systems can include websites, internal systems, and various services. Tracardi\nidentifies and logs this inbound traffic, assigning it a unique identifier to track its origin and behavior.\n\nAn event source serves as a bridge between the external system and Tracardi. It collects data from a specific source,\nsuch as a queue, email, or social media, and transfers it to Tracardi for further processing. For instance, Tracardi can\nuse an API bridge to collect data from an API's \"/track\" endpoint and bring it into the system. Depending on the version\nof Tracardi being used, there may be different types of bridges, such as a Kafka bridge, designed to collect data from a\nKafka message broker.\n\nWhen setting up a new project with Tracardi, it is essential to create a new event source. This event source provides an\nidentifier that can be attached to track calls, enabling the collection of data about users. However, it's worth noting\nthat an event source can be configured as ephemeral, meaning the data received through this type of event source is not\nstored permanently in the system. Instead, it is used and processed by the workflow in real-time, without the need for\nlong-term storage.\n\nImportant to consider is that certain sources may require user consent before collecting and storing their data. For\nexample, a web page might need user consent to gather and retain their data for processing.\n", "hash": "2f11db1ed6f0e1a78d44ff69c8e0d8bea2c958c9"}
