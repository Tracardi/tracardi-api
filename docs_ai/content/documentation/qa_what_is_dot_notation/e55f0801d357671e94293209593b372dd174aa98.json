It is used to access data from the internal state of\nthe workflow, such as the event, profile, payload, flow, session, and memory. It is written in the form\nof `<source>@<path.to.data>`, where the source is the type of data you are referencing and the path is a string of keys\nthat indicate where the data is located.\n\nFor example, if you wanted to access the data from the profile with the key `key.data`, the full dot notation would\nbe `profile@key.data`. You can also use dot notation to access parts of data, such as everything below a certain key, or\nitems in an array. In some cases, you may need to use dot notation to access data with keys that contain spaces, in\nwhich case you would use `profile@key[\"My key with spaces\"]`.\n\nFor more information look for dot notation in the documentation.\n\n---\nThis document answers the following questions:\n- How to get profile, event, or session data?\n- How to reference profile, event, or session data?\n- How to get data from profile, event, session, memory, workflow.\n"}
