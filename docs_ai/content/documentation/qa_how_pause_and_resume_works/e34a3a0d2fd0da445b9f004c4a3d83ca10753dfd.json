How does the pause event affect the workflow completion time?", "3. What happens to the event during the pause time?"], "answer": "# Does the pause event impact the performance? Causing the workflow cannot complete in several days.\nThe pause event does not directly impact the performance of the current event process. When you pause an\nevent, it is sent to a background scheduled task and placed in a queue for completion. This means that the current event\nprocess continues without being affected by the pause.\n\nOnce the pause time is finished, the event either resumes as a separate event if it has been configured as such, or it\nresumes as an internal system event that is not recorded but processed. In either case, the response to the current\nevent is returned immediately, allowing the process to continue uninterrupted.\n\nOverall, the pause event has minimal impact on the performance of the current event process, as it is handled separately\nin the background without interrupting the ongoing operations.\n", "hash": "e34a3a0d2fd0da445b9f004c4a3d83ca10753dfd"}
