It includes:\n\n- Plugin specifications such as the module and class name, input and output ports, version, license, author information,\n  initialization values, and a manual reference.\n- Form configuration that defines the user interface for configuring the plugin. It includes form groups, form fields,\n  and their respective properties such as labels and descriptions.\n- Metadata information such as the plugin name, description, icon, group, and documentation details including inputs and\n  outputs descriptions.\n\nBy using this code template, you can create your own Tracardi plugins that generate passwords or perform other custom\nactions with configurable settings.\n\n---\nThis document answers the questions:\n- How to write a custom plugin?\n", "hash": "f49505902d3b959e09d27fb00dbf40fd02cd0740"}
