The session ID changes\nwhen the user opens a new browser or visits a new page, representing a new session or visit. However, the session ID\nremains the same between the visits or interactions within a session. In the context of web page the script that is placed\non the wab page is responsible for changing the session ID when the browser is closed. \n\nIt's important to note that the system automatically increments the visit counts in the profile when the session ID\nchanges, reflecting the number of visits or sessions associated with that profile.\n\n## Data Example\n\nVisit one.\n\nEvent tables\n\n|Event ID  | Profile ID | Session ID |\n|----------|------------|------------|\n|1| 1 | 1\n|2| 1 | 1\n|3| 1 | 1\n\nVisit two\n\n|Event ID  | Profile ID | Session ID |\n|----------|------------|------------|\n|4| 1 | 2\n|5| 1 | 2\n|6| 1 | 2\n\nVisit counts in profile are automatically incremented when the session id changes. \n\n## Debugging and Session IDs\n\nWhen utilizing the debug mode in the workflow editor, it's important to note that the behavior of session IDs may differ\nfrom regular operation. In debug mode, the session ID remains the same for every simulated event, which can impact the\nexpected functionality.\n\nDuring debugging, the workflow editor creates a fake event and session to simulate the execution of the workflow. The\nIDs assigned to these debug entities are constant, meaning they don't change with each iteration or interaction. This\nconsistent session ID can affect the expected behavior of the system, as it deviates from the dynamic session ID changes\nthat occur in regular user sessions.\n\nIt's crucial to consider this discrepancy when debugging workflows that involve session-dependent logic or\nfunctionality. If the workflow relies on different session IDs for distinct visits or interactions, the debug mode's\nstatic session ID may not accurately reflect the intended behavior (it will not increase the visits in profile).\n\nTo overcome this limitation, it's recommended to thoroughly test the workflow in a test mode (See test in the left-hand\nmenu). By doing so, you can ensure that\nthe workflow functions as expected under normal conditions, considering the dynamic nature of session IDs in actual user\nsessions.\n\nKeep in mind that the debug mode's static session ID serves the purpose of simplifying the debugging process by\nproviding consistency and predictability. However, it's important to be aware of its impact on session-dependent logic\nwhen transitioning from debug mode to live deployment.\n", "hash": "8090f8331146937881d09199e0440711fe0ab242"}
