How can you set the time for destination synchronization in Tracardi?"], "answer": "# Outbound traffic\nTracardi can sync profiles with external systems. To do this use destinations.\n\nDestination is a set of credentials that point to an external system where the profile data will be sent when if\nchanged. Destination require some resource, e.g. a API endpoint, queue service, etc. This is here you set all the\nrequired information on the credentials and the location of the external system. Not all resources are available as\ndestinations.\n\nDepending on the system version, the list of available destinations may change. The easiest way to check the available\nones is to go to the `resources/extensions` tab and filter out `type/destinations`. To use one of them you need to\ninstall.\n\nIn version 0.7.2, the following resources were available for use as a destination.\n\n* [Rabbitmq](../../resources/rabbitmq_resource.md)\n* [Mautic](../../resources/mautic_resource.md)\n* Remote API\n\nWhen we have the resource to which we want to send data from the profile, go to the outbound traffic tab and select tab\ndestinations.\n\nIn the destination field you should see the resource. Then describe the destination in the __Destination description__\nand fill the following fields:\n\n* __Destination prerequisites__ - enter the condition that must be met for the profile synchronization to start with the\n  external system. For example, `profile@data.contact.email exists` - it means that there must be an e-mail in the profile to\n  forward the data. The point is that the external system may require specific data to identify the user. You can leave\n  this field blank that means, that regardless of the quality of the data, it will be sent to the destination system. To\n  write a correct condition please read [how to use logic notation](../../notations/logic_notation.md)\n* __Mapping__ - in this field we define the format of the data sent to the external system. The data is sent in the form\n  of JSON. The data schema in Tracardi may differ from the expected schema in the external system. Here we can remap the\n  data. Remapping is done by object\n  templates. [Please read more on object templates](../../notations/object_template.md).\n* __Destination setting__ - There may be additional destination settings required. Please fill them. For example an API\n  call may require call method, or headers.\n\n!!! Info\n\n    __Destination is not synchronized right away after the first profile update__. The synchronisation is a postponed \n    process it means it will trigger after some time when the profile update process ends. For exmaple, when the \n    profile is updated every second for\n    ten seconds the synchronisation will start after 20 seconds after the last update. That means not earlier then\n    30 seconds from the first profile change. This is done on purpose to not stress the remote system. \n\n!!! Tip\n\n    To set the time after the destination system is synchronized use environment variable: POSTPONE_DESTINATION_SYNC.\n", "hash": "08be2a86d3e59d651cccb36c4eb7538e2b9d0779"}
