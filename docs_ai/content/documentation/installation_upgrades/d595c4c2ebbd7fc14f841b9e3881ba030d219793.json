This means that manual data\nmigration by re-indexing is necessary. If the collected data in previous versions is not important and it is possible to\nlose it, a fresh installation is recommended.\n\n### Manual Transfer\n\nTo transfer data, first check what indexes you have in Elasticsearch. This can be done by going to _Monitoring /\nElasticsearch indices_ in Tracardi. Indexes marked as _Connected_ are currently in use and are prefixed with a version\nnumber. Old indexes from system e.g. version 0.6.0, do not have a prefix and are marked as _Not Connected_.\n\nTo transfer data, use the reindex function available in Elasticsearch. Documentation of this functionality can be\nfound [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-reindex.html). Reindexing data is\nnothing more than copying it from one index to another.\n\n---\n\nThis documentation answers the following questions:\n\n* How can I upgrade Tracardi?\n* What is data migration?\n* How to migrate Tracardi to a new version?\n* What's the minimum version required for automated system upgrades in Tracardi?\n* What was the limitation with system data upgrades in versions before 0.7.0?\n* How does Tracardi handle indexes when upgrading to a new version?\n* Why is it important to install dockers with a tagged version during system upgrades?\n* Do you need to manually migrate data when upgrading from a version before 0.7.0 to version 0.7.0?\n* How can you check your indexes in Elasticsearch when transferring data?\n", "hash": "d595c4c2ebbd7fc14f841b9e3881ba030d219793"}
