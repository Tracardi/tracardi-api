This is achieved by creating an\nidentification point in Tracardi that checks if there are any profiles with the same merging key, eg. email address,\ntelephone number, etc. It merges existing profiles generated through-out the customer journey into one profile. The\nresulting profile may have multiple profile IDs, which are used to identify different devices in order to have\none profile data available to all devices."}
