An example usage of this event would be when\na customer signs up for a loyalty program and is issued a loyalty card.\n\n## Expected properties\n\n!!! Tip \n    \n    All properties are optional. If any property is missing it will not be processed and no error will be reported.\n\n| Name    | Expected type   | Example                                            |\n|---------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| expires | datetime        | 2023-12-31T23:59:59.999Z                          |\n| name    | string          | My Loyalty Card                                    |\n| issuer  | string          | MyStore                                            |\n| id      | string          | 12345                                              |\n\n## Auto indexing\n\nAuto indexing helps to make data easy to find by creating a structure that organizes the data. This structure is made by\ncopying information from the different parts of the data and putting it into a specific format that can be used to\nanalyze and group the data. This is particularly helpful when dealing with unstructured data that needs to be organized\nin order to be useful.\n\nThis table describes which event property will be copied to event traits.\n\n| Event trait          | Event properties   |\n|----------------------|--------------------|\n| loyalty.card.id      | id                 |\n| loyalty.card.name    | name               |\n| loyalty.card.issuer  | issuer             |\n| loyalty.card.expires | expires            | \n\n## Copy event data to profile\n\nWhen an event occurs, the data associated with it will be automatically duplicated in certain profile properties. You\ncan refer to the table below for the exact mapping of which fields will be copied.\n\n| Profile field             | Event field                 | Action                                                                   |\n|---------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| data.loyalty.card.id      | traits.loyalty.card.id      | Data will be assigned to profile always regardless if it was set or not. |\n| data.loyalty.card.name    | traits.loyalty.card.name    | Data will be assigned to profile always regardless if it was set or not. |\n| data.loyalty.card.issuer  | traits.loyalty.card.issuer  | Data will be assigned to profile always regardless if it was set or not. |\n| data.loyalty.card.expires | traits.loyalty.card.expires | Data will be assigned to profile always regardless if it was set or not. |\n\n## JSON example\n\nHere is an example of how the event data might look in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"loyalty-card-added\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"expires\": \"2023-12-31T23:59:59.999Z\",\n    \"name\": \"My Loyalty Card\",\n    \"issuer\": \"MyStore\",\n    \"id\": \"12345\"\n  }\n}\n```\n"}
