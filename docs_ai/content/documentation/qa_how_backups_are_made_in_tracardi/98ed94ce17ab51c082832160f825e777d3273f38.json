A snapshot\n   repository is a location where Elasticsearch stores the backup data. It can be a shared file system, a cloud storage\n   service, or a network-attached storage (NAS).\n\n2. **Snapshot Lifecycle**: You define a snapshot lifecycle policy that specifies how often to take backups and how long\n   to retain them. This policy automates the backup process and ensures that backups are created at regular intervals.\n\n3. **Snapshot Creation**: When a snapshot is created, Elasticsearch takes a point-in-time copy of the data and metadata\n   in the cluster. This includes index data, index settings, mappings, and other relevant information. The snapshot is\n   stored in the designated repository.\n\n4. **Incremental Backups**: Elasticsearch uses incremental backups, which means that subsequent snapshots only include\n   the changes since the last snapshot. This reduces the backup time and storage requirements.\n\n5. **Snapshot and Restore API**: Elasticsearch provides a Snapshot and Restore API that allows you to manage the backup\n   process. You can create, list, restore, and delete snapshots using this API. You can also monitor the status of\n   snapshot operations and track the progress.\n\n6. **Cluster Coordination**: When taking snapshots, Elasticsearch coordinates the backup process across all nodes in the\n   cluster. It ensures that each shard of the data is captured and included in the backup, even in a distributed cluster\n   setup.\n\n7. **Backup Verification**: Elasticsearch allows you to verify the integrity of a snapshot by performing a verification\n   process. This ensures that the backup data is intact and can be restored successfully if needed.\n\n8. **Disaster Recovery**: In the event of a disaster or data loss, you can restore a snapshot to recover your data.\n   Elasticsearch provides options to restore the entire cluster, specific indices, or individual shards from a snapshot.\n\nPlease read more about Elasticsearch (ES) backups in documentation.\n", "hash": "98ed94ce17ab51c082832160f825e777d3273f38"}
