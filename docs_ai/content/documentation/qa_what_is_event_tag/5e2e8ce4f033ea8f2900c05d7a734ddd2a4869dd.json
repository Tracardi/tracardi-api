Why are event tags important in Tracardi for creating a customer journey map?"], "answer": "# What is event tag?\nAn event tag is a label or identifier that is associated with a specific event to categorize and organize it based on\ncertain attributes or characteristics. Event tags serve as metadata that provides additional information about the\nevent, making it easier to search, filter, and analyze events with similar tags.\n\nEvent tags are customizable and can be used to represent various aspects of the event, such as its type, status,\nlocation, or any other relevant attribute. They offer a way to group events together based on common properties,\nfacilitating better organization and management of event data.\n\nFor example, in Tracardi, events related to product purchases could be tagged with labels like \"\npurchase,\" \"transaction,\" or \"completed order.\" Some events in Tracardi are automatically tagged to create a customer\njourney map, providing a visual representation of how customers engage over time.\n", "hash": "5e2e8ce4f033ea8f2900c05d7a734ddd2a4869dd"}
