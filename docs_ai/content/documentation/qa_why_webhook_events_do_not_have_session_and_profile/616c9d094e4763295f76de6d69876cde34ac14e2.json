{"file_name": "docs/qa/why_webhook_events_do_not_have_session_and_profile.md", "questions": ["What is the default behavior of webhook events regarding session and profile information?"], "answer": "# Why webhook events dot not have session and profile?\nBy default, webhook events do not include session and profile information. This design choice is based on the fact that\nmost external systems are unaware of the Tracaardi Profile ID and session ID. Although it is possible to create a\nwebhook URL that incorporates an encoded session ID, it is rarely used due to the difficulty of passing session\ninformation through a URL in external systems. In practice, approximately 99% of the time, the profile ID or session ID\nis transmitted within the webhook payload data.\n\nTo address this limitation, we provide an option to replace or set the profile ID or session ID of the event collected\nby the webhook URL using the payload data. This allows users to customize and manage the session and profile information\nassociated with webhook events effectively.\n\nWhen configuring webhook integrations, it is important to keep in mind that the default behavior does not include\nsession and profile information. However, by extracting and manipulating the relevant data from the payload, users can\nintegrate their desired session and profile details into webhook events seamlessly.\n"}
