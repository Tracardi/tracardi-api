It can provide valuable insights into how customers are engaging with your products and\ncan help you identify which products are being shared the most.\n\nExample usage:\n\n* A customer is browsing your website and finds a product they really like. They click on the \"Share\" button and choose\n  to send a link to the product page to a friend via email. This action would trigger the \"Product Shared\" event.\n\n## Expected properties.\n\n!!! Tip \n\n    All properties are optional. If any property is missing it will not be processed and no error will be reported.\n\n| Name   | Expected type   | Example                                              |\n|--------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| media  | string          | \"Facebook\" |\n| id     | string          | Product ID: \"abc-1234\"    |\n\n## Auto indexing\n\nAuto indexing helps to make data easy to find by creating a structure that organizes the data. This structure is made by\ncopying information from the different parts of the data and putting it into a specific format that can be used to\nanalyze and group the data. This is particularly helpful when dealing with unstructured data that needs to be organized\nin order to be useful.\n\nThis table describes which event property will be copied to event traits.\n\n| Event trait    | Event properties   |   \n|----------------|--------------------|   \n|ec.product.id|id|\n|marketing.channel|media|\n\n## Copy event data to profile\n\nData will not be copied to profile.\n\n## JSON example\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"product-shared\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"media\": \"Facebook\",\n    \"id\": \"abc-1234\"\n  }\n}\n\n```\n"}
