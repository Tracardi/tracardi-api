{"file_name": "docs/qa/bulk/other_qa.md", "questions": ["What is the maximum number of customer interactions Tracardi can log?"], "answer": "# Other Q&A\n__Q: Is it possible to segment data based on leads' attributes such as lead added date, lead source, lead ID, opens,__\nclicks, sold/not sold, click/open dates, etc.?\n\nA: Yes, segmentation can be done in regular Tracardi workflows. You can segment data based on any internal or external\ndata or conditions set within the workflow.\n\n__Q: How many customer interactions can Tracardi log, including opens, clicks, and sales over the life of the lead?__\n\nA: Tracardi has been tested to store 10 million events per profile, but the limit ultimately depends on the storage\nsize. Tracardi is designed to handle large volumes of data efficiently, as evidenced by instances with 0.3 billion\nevents loading in a fraction of a second. The scalability is mainly due to the storage capabilities of Elasticsearch.\n\n__Q: Can Tracardi import customer interactions from external email marketing software like Mailwizz? Is it streamed live\nor can it be scheduled? __\n\nA: To import customer interactions from Mailwizz or similar software, you can set up a trigger in the software's table\nto copy the interaction records to another table. Then, a script can move the copied records to Tracardi using the\nTracardi API and remove the duplicated records. This process can be scheduled using cron jobs, Kubernetes jobs, or other\nscheduling mechanisms. If Mailwizz supports webhooks, real-time importing can be achieved through webhooks.\nAdditionally, you can include pixels in emails for further tracking if required.\n\n__Q: Can newly added data be analyzed for duplicates or used to enrich current profiles if it's the same lead? Are leads\nassigned a unique ID?__\n\nA: Tracardi's main purpose is to maintain a single profile that includes data copied from events or external systems.\nThe profiles are automatically merged and deduplicated at identification points if configured to do so. Tracardi assigns\nunique IDs to leads, and it also keeps a history of previous IDs. This allows Tracardi to track customers across\ndifferent devices and merge their profiles.\n\n__Q: Does Tracardi need to be integrated with a data warehouse tool to store all the data? Are there any recommendations\nfor such integration?__\n\nA: Tracardi uses Elasticsearch and Kibana for simple analytics, providing a comprehensive overview of individual\nprofiles. However, Tracardi is not designed as an analytical tool for aggregate analysis of all customers. For in-depth\nanalysis, it is recommended to use an external system of your choice. Tracardi can send event data to external systems\nif necessary, allowing integration with data warehouse tools or other analytical platforms.\n", "hash": "ffcf1fd0b9ff2ab33d664f251ee2deabf8f0d2f0"}
