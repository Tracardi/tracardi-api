Basically plugins can be\nconfigured with JSON objects. Forms map the form fields with the JSON. When changes are made within the form, it is\nreflected in the JSON configuration and vice-versa.\n\nFor instance, when we have a form like this\n\n```python\nform = Form(groups=[\n   FormGroup(\n      name=\"Event type plugin configuration\",\n      description=\"Define required event type\",\n      fields=[\n         FormField(\n            id=\"resource\",\n            name=\"Resource\",\n            description=\"Select your API resource.\",\n            component=FormComponent(type=\"resource\", props={\"label\": \"API Resource\", \"tag\": \"api\"})\n         ),\n         FormField(\n            id=\"event_type\",\n            name=\"Event type\",\n            description=\"Event type to check\",\n            component=FormComponent(type=\"text\", props={\"label\": \"Event type\"})\n         )\n      ]\n   )\n]),\n```\n\nand JSON configuration like this:\n\n```json\ninit={\n   \"resource\": {\n      \"id\": \"\",\n      \"name\": \"\"\n   },\n   \"event_type\": {\n      \"id\": \"\",\n      \"name\": \"\"\n   }\n}\n```\n\nThat means the `FormGroup` \"Event type plugin configuration\" is created with two `FormField`s: \"Resource\" and \"Event\ntype\". The `id` of a `FormField` must match with a configuration property in `init`, allowing for a connection between the form\nvalue and the configuration value. This is explained as \"This is how you bind configuration with the form field.\" in the\ndocumentation.", "hash": "4454b8bbef95a4fd3027f7b3d1dae4257a955f20"}
