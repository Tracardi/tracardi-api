How does session tracking with Tracardi contribute to understanding user behavior and providing a personalized user experience?"], "answer": "# Session\nA session refers to a specific period of time during which a user interacts with a website or application. This concept\nis essential for analyzing user engagement, understanding user journeys, and providing personalized experiences.\n\nWhen a user visits a website or application integrated with Tracardi, a unique session ID is assigned to them. This ID\nis typically stored in a cookie on the user's device, or in device memory. The session ID enables Tracardi to recognize\nand associate the user's actions and events within a specific session.\n\nThe Tracardi system calculates visits based on the continuity of the session ID. If the session ID remains the same, it\nsuggests that the user is still actively engaging with the website or application. Consequently, Tracardi considers this\nas part of the same visit. However, if the user closes their browser, or when the session expires, the session ID gets\ndeleted. A new session begins when the user revisits the site.\n\nThrough tracking sessions, Tracardi can offer insights into various aspects of user behavior. For instance, it can\ncalculate session duration, page views per session, entry and exit points, and conversion rates.\n\nFor example, suppose there is a website integrated with Tracardi. When a user visits this site, a session begins, and\nthe user gets a unique session ID, stored in a cookie on their device. The activities that the user conducts on the\nwebsite, like viewing different pages, adding items to the cart, purchasing an item, etc., are tracked under this\nsession ID. If the user closes the site and comes back later, a new session with a new ID starts.\n\nThis session tracking aids in understanding the user behavior during each visit, providing a personalized user\nexperience, and so forth.\n", "hash": "8d51f1eb57ac16569a361b781f66e1edc94bdb98"}
