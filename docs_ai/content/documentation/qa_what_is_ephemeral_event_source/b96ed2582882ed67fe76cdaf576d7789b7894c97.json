Navigate to the `inbound traffic` / `event source` configuration settings.\n2. Locate the specific event source that you want to configure as ephemeral and access its settings.\n3. Look for the `advanced options` or advanced settings section within the event source configuration.\n4. Within the advanced options, you should find an option related to the transactional event type.\n5. Adjust the settings to enable the ephemeral mode for the event source. \n6. Save the changes to apply the ephemeral transactional settings to the event source.\n\nBy following these steps, you can configure the event source as ephemeral, ensuring that the data received through this\nsource is not stored permanently but is processed and used only for the duration of the workflow or a limited period of\ntime.\n", "hash": "b96ed2582882ed67fe76cdaf576d7789b7894c97"}
