Instead, it is processed and used only during the workflow. This approach allows for\nreal-time processing and analysis of data without the requirement of long-term storage. The data is utilized within the\nworkflow or system for immediate operations and insights, but it is not retained for the long term in the database.", "hash": "0db2bd271859c92a5279c86ebe1885f7cb398e7f"}
