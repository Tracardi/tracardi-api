It includes\npertinent details that contribute to a deeper comprehension of the event's surrounding circumstances. The specific\ncontent of event context may vary based on the event's nature and the system or application requirements.\n\nThis additional data can take the form of metadata, providing context-specific information associated with the event.\nExamples include contextual tags, event categories, or any custom contextual data tailored to the particular application\nor system.\n\n### Options\n\nEvent options provide additional instructions or directives related to the processing of an event. They can specify how\nthe event should be handled, what actions to take, or what data to return as a result of processing the event. Here are\nsome examples of what can be included as event options:\n\n```\n\"options\": {\n        \"saveEvent\": false,\n        \"saveSession\": false,\n        \"debugger\": false\n      },\n```\n\nHere is the description of the configuration options in a table format:\n\n| Option      | Description                                                                                                                                               |\n|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| saveEvent   | Determines whether the event should be saved or treated as ephemeral. If set to `false`, the event is processed but not permanently saved.                    |\n| saveSession | Specifies whether the session associated with the event should be saved. If set to `false`, the session data will not be stored for this particular event. |\n| debugger    | Controls the inclusion of debugger information in the event response. If set to `false`, debugger information will not be returned.                          |\n\n### Tags\n\nWhen choosing tags for a specific event, consider the event type, relevant attributes, business context, and analytical\nneeds. Use consistent and meaningful tags to categorize and organize events effectively.\n", "hash": "cda107ea5496f4728c12e012a722764a35170518"}
