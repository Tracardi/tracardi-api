When an internal event is used,\nthe system automatically detects it and fills up the profile and session with appropriate data.\n\nHowever, if the default event does not expect the data that you want to send, don't worry. You can still send the data\nand copy it manually. Other defined properties will be copied automatically, and the missing ones will be saved in the\nevent and can be moved to the profile manually.\n\nThe following are some examples of Tracardi internal events:\n\n* __Page View__: This event is triggered when a customer visits a new page on your website or application. It captures the\n  URL of the page and the time of the visit.\n\n* __Search__: This event is triggered when a customer performs a search on your website or application. It captures the\n  search query and the category of the search.\n\n* __Signup__: This event is triggered when a customer signs up for an account on your website or application. It captures\n  the customer's first name, last name, email address, and login information.\n\n* __Identification__: This event is triggered when a customer logs into their account on your website or application. It\n  captures the customer's login information.\n\n* __Purchase Order__: This event is triggered when a customer makes a purchase on your website or application. It captures\n  the details of the purchase, including the product ID, name, price, and quantity.\n\n* __Cart Update__: This event is triggered when a customer adds or removes items from their shopping cart on your website or\n  application. It captures the details of the update, including the product ID, name, price, and quantity.\n\nUsing Tracardi internal events helps you understand your customers' behavior and preferences, allowing you to optimize\nyour website or application for better engagement and conversions.\n"}
