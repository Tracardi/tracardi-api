Multi-tenancy is a software\narchitecture where a single instance of the software serves multiple clients, known as tenants, while keeping their data\nand configurations separate.\n\nThe specific error message \"Tenant not allowed\" suggests that the URL you are trying to access is associated with a\ntenant that is not registered or allowed within the system. To resolve this issue, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Verify Tenant Registration**: Check if the tenant you are trying to access is properly registered in the system.\n\n2. **Add New Tenant**: If the tenant is not registered, you need to add them to the system. This process typically\n   involves creating a new tenant profile with the necessary configurations and settings.\n\n3. **Tenant URL Configuration**: Double-check that the URL you are using to access the API corresponds to the registered\n   tenant.\n\n4. **Documentation and Support**: Review the documentation or seek support from the platform or service provider you are\n   using. They might have specific guidelines or troubleshooting steps to resolve multi-tenancy-related issues.\n", "hash": "ec047cf9a4351dc252081488bf87ad667daa4f1b"}
