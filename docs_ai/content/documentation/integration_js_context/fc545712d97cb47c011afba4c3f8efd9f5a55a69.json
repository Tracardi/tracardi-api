And later merge the profile if customer provides data that can be used \nfor this. \n\nTo enable this functionality, you can add the following code: `trackExternalLinks: ['example.com', 'tracardi.com']`. \nThis will automatically update all `A.href` links on the page \nwith the `__tr_pid`, `__tr_src` parameter, which will contain the current profile ID, source ID respectively, if\nthe A.href URL end with any of the defined domains in `trackExternalLinks`. In our example it is 'example.com' and , \n'tracardi.com'.\n\n```javascript title=\"Example\" linenums=\"1\" hl_lines=\"10-12\"\n    const options = {\n      tracker: {\n        url: {\n            script: 'http://localhost:8686/tracker',\n            api: 'http://localhost:8686'\n        },\n        source: {\n            id: \"3ee63fc6-490a-4fd8-bfb3-bf0c8c8d3387\"\n        },\n        settings: {\n          trackExternalLinks: ['example.com', 'tracardi.com']\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nTracardi recognize these params and saves them in `session.context` and replaces profile ID with the profile ID\nreferenced in `__tr_pid`\n\n!!! Warning\n\n    Profile must exist in Tracardi to be passed from domain to domain. If profile does not exist then\n    new profile ID will be generated and a Javascript warning will be logged: `Referred Tracardi Profile Id\n    {referred_profile_id} is invalid`.\n\n!!! Notice\n\n    This feature is available from version 0.8.1 up.\n\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"context\": {\n    \"tracardi\": {\n      \"pass\": {\n        \"profile\": \"0adfd4c8-36eb-40cd-9350-5df37706286a\",\n        \"source\": \"d15aaf64-90ff-4c72-9d93-e7851c326127\",\n        \"session\": \"9cb9a69b-e657-47dc-85f6-791ebc4b4822\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWhere possible system will use this information to merge profiles between devices and browsers. \n\n!!! Tip\n\n    The script utilizes an underlying technique that involves creating a POST payload for the tracker, with \n    parameters such as `__tr_pid`, `__tr_src`. The payload contains data sent in a specific context, \n    formatted as follows in JSON:\n    \n    ```json\n    {\n      \"source\": {\n        \"id\": \"d15aaf64-90ff-4c72-9d93-e7851c326127\"\n      },\n      \"context\": {\n        \"tracardi\": {\n          \"pass\": {\n            \"profile\": \"0adfd4c8-36eb-40cd-9350-5df37706286a\",\n            \"source\": \"d15aaf64-90ff-4c72-9d93-e7851c326127\"\n          }\n        }\n      },\n      \"profile\": {\n        \"id\": \"0adfd4c8-36eb-40cd-9350-5df37706286a\"\n      },\n      \"session\": {\n        \"id\": \"3a18978e-1d74-4382-8e50-f0b8ae3c2d55\"\n      },\n      \"options\": {},\n      \"events\": [ ... ]\n    }\n    ```\n\n    This technique can be used also to reference profile ID from browser to device. \n    However you will need a find a way to pass the refered profile ID, session ID, and source ID to your mobile \n    device when the app is opened, and the first `/track` payload should include the refered IDs. The same \n    will also work with other systems. \n\nTo disable params `__tr_pid`, `__tr_src` and turn off session context, set `tracardiPass` to `false` in \ntracker context:\n\n```javascript title=\"Example\" linenums=\"1\" hl_lines=\"10-12\"\n    const options = {\n      tracker: {\n        url: {\n            script: 'http://localhost:8686/track"}
