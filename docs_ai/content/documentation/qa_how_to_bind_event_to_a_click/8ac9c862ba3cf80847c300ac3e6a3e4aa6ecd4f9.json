First, you need to add an onClick event to the button, like this: \n\n```html\n<button onClick=\"testClick()\">Test click</button>\n```\n\nThen, you need to create a function that will send an event when the button is clicked. This function should be added to the JavaScript code, like this: \n\n```html title=\"Example\" linenums=\"1\"\n<script>\n  function testClick() {\n     window.tracker.track(\"page-view\", {\"view\": 1});\n  }\n</script>\n```\n\nThis code will record the event in the console, but it won't be sent to Tracardi by default. To trigger the event and send it to Tracardi immediately, you need to add the `fire` attribute with a value of `true` as a parameter to the window.tracker.track function, like this: \n\n```html title=\"Example\" linenums=\"1\"\n<script>\n  function testClick() {\n     window.tracker.track(\"page-view\", {\"view\": 1}, {\"fire\": true}); // (1)\n  }\n</script>\n```\n\nThis will send the event to Tracardi immediately.\n"}
