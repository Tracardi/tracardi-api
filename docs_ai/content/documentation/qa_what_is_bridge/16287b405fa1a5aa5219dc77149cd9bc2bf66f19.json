How does a bridge in Tracardi facilitate data exchange between separate systems?", "3. What is the role of a bridge in collecting data from external sources and transferring it to Tracardi?", "4. What types of bridges are available in different versions of Tracardi and how do they integrate with data sources?", "5. How does a bridge in Tracardi enable smooth data transfer and integration between external sources and the Tracardi system?"], "answer": "# What is bridge?\nA bridge is a piece of software that serves as a communication link between two\nseparate systems or applications. Its primary function is to facilitate the exchange of data between these systems,\nallowing them to interact seamlessly.\n\nSpecifically, in Tracardi, a bridge is responsible for collecting data from a particular source, such as a queue, email,\nsocial media, or any other external system, and then transferring that data to an event source within Tracardi. The\nevent source, in turn, processes and handles the incoming data as part of Tracardi's workflows and data processing\ncapabilities.\n\nFor example, Tracardi may come with an open-source API bridge that enables the collection of data from an API's `/track`\nendpoint. This data can then be seamlessly transferred to the Tracardi system for further processing and analysis.\n\nDifferent types of bridges may be available based on the version of Tracardi being used. For instance, commercial\nversions of Tracardi might include bridges for integrating with various data sources, such as a Kafka bridge that allows\nthe collection of data from a Kafka message broker.\n\nIn summary, a bridge in Tracardi acts as a conduit, connecting external data sources to the Tracardi system, enabling\nsmooth data transfer and integration.\n", "hash": "16287b405fa1a5aa5219dc77149cd9bc2bf66f19"}
