What is the recommended usage of the production API in Tracardi's graphical user interface?"], "answer": "# What does staging mean in tracardi version?\nIn Tracardi, staging refers to a server environment used to test and debug configuration changes before they are\ndeployed to a production server. The purpose of staging is to ensure that new configurations can be thoroughly\ntested in a controlled environment without impacting the live production website or application.\n\nWhen connected to the staging API, it means that you are using the API version specifically designed for collecting test\ndata. This allows you to perform tests without affecting the production data. The staging environment keeps the test\ndata separate from the production data, ensuring that any changes or experiments you make are isolated and do not\ninterfere with the live system.\n\nIn terms of the graphical user interface (GUI), it is possible for it to connect to both the staging and production\nAPIs. However, it is advisable to connect to the staging API with the GUI when performing tests. The production API\nshould be reserved for actual usage by webpages or mobile phones, as it needs to be exposed to the internet to receive\nreal user data.\n\nBy connecting to the staging API with the GUI, you can safely experiment and validate new configurations without\naffecting the production environment. Also, Production data is visible in a read only mode.\n", "hash": "70900347b3147f4eb75ee3272648ac3e5847d5aa"}
