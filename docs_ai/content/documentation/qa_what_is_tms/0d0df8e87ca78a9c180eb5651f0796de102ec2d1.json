Tenant Management involves overseeing various aspects related to individual\ntenants in a platform.\n\nThe key responsibilities of the Tenant Management Service (TMS) include:\n\n1. **Creating Tenants**: TMS is responsible for creating new tenant accounts within the system. It sets up the necessary\n   infrastructure and resources for each tenant, ensuring their isolation and independence.\n\n2. **Retrieving Tenant Information**: TMS provides functionality to query and access specific data, settings, and\n   attributes associated with existing tenants. This allows the system to retrieve tenant-related information whenever\n   needed.\n\n3. **Validating Tenants**: TMS ensures that only valid and authorized tenants can access the system. It performs checks\n   to verify if a tenant is registered and has the required permissions to use the platform.\n\n4. **Tracardi Integration**: In a multi-tenant environment, where multiple tenants interact with the\n   system, TMS plays a pivotal role. It validates tenant credentials, ensures they are registered, and handles\n   operations such as creating or deleting a tenant.\n\nTo create a new tenant in Tracardi's multi-tenant setup, developers use the Tenant Management Service (TMS) API. The\nprocess involves setting up the TMS, making an API call to create a new tenant, and providing essential information to\nset up the tenant. The API returns a generated API key, which serves as the authentication token for accessing the\nTracardi API on behalf of the tenant. Additionally, TMS facilitates the creation of a tenant domain, installation token,\nand other essential components for the tenant.\n", "hash": "0d0df8e87ca78a9c180eb5651f0796de102ec2d1"}
