Each worker\nserves a specific purpose in the Tracardi ecosystem. Below are details about each worker and instructions on how to set\nthem up.\n\n## 1. Open-Source Migration and Import Worker\n\nThe Migration and Import Worker is responsible for system upgrades and data import tasks, which are carried out in the\nbackground. It ensures a seamless transition when updating the Tracardi system and handles data imports efficiently.\n\nTo run the Migration and Import Worker, execute the following Docker command:\n\n```bash\ndocker run \\\n-e REDIS_HOST=redis://<redis-ip>:6379 \\\ntracardi/update-worker:0.8.1\n```\n\nPlease ensure that you replace `<redis-ip>` with the actual IP address of your Redis instance.\n\n## 2. Commercial Worker for Segmentation and Mapping\n\nThe Commercial Worker for Segmentation, Post-Collection Event Mapping, and Post-Collection Profile Mapping plays a vital\nrole in processing commercial tasks, including segmentation (both workflow and conditional) and mapping events and\nprofiles after collection.\n\nTo run this worker, execute the following Docker command:\n\n```bash\ndocker run \\\n-e ELASTIC_HOST=http://<elastic-ip>:9200 \\\n-e REDIS_HOST=redis://<redis-ip>:6379 \\\n-e LOGGING_LEVEL=info \\\ntracardi/com-tracardi-segmentation-worker:0.8.1\n```\n\n## 3. Scheduler Worker\n\nThe Scheduler Worker is a commercial worker responsible for processing delayed events. It ensures that time-based\ntriggers and other delayed tasks are executed efficiently.\n\nTo run the Scheduler Worker, execute the following Docker command:\n\n```bash\ndocker run \\\n-e ELASTIC_HOST=http://<elastic-ip>:9200 \\\n-e REDIS_HOST=<redis-ip> \\\n-e LOGGING_LEVEL=info \\\ntracardi/com-tracardi-scheduler-worker:0.8.1\n```\n\n## 4. Post-Collection Worker\n\nThe Post-Collection Event Mapping, and Post-Collection Profile Mapping is required for mapping events and\nprofiles after collection.\n\n```bash\ndocker run \\\n-e ELASTIC_HOST=http://<elastic-ip>:9200 \\\n-e REDIS_HOST=redis://<redis-ip>:6379 \\\n-e LOGGING_LEVEL=info \\\ntracardi/com-tracardi-coping-worker:0.8.1\n```\n\n## Additional Information\n\nFor more detailed information on the features and capabilities of the Scheduler Worker, please refer to the\ndocumentation pages that cover its functionalities. These pages will provide you with insights into effectively\nutilizing the Scheduler Worker to meet your specific use cases and requirements.\n", "hash": "649b77798b6e39037f3cb4295550a82529197fa8"}
