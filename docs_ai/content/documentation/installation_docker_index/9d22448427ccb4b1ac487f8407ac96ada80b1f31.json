Run the following \ncommand to start the worker. \n\n```bash\ndocker run -e REDIS_HOST=redis://<redis-ip>:6379 -d tracardi/update-worker:0.8.0 #(1)\n```\n\n1. If you want a certain version of docker image add version tag, e.g. `tracardi/worker:0.8.0`\n\n\n!!! Note\n\n    Replace the `<redis-ip>` with the IP of the redis instance. Keep the version of worker the same as \n    `tracard/tracardi-api`\n\n## Tracardi Graphical User Interface\n\nVisit http://127.0.0.1:8787 and follow the instructions to set up Tracardi.
