In this documentation, we will guide you through the steps to start an import worker\nand resolve import pending errors.\n\n### Step 1: Start Tracardi Worker\n\nTo start importing data, you need to start the Tracardi worker that will import data in the background. You can use the\nfollowing Docker command to start the worker:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -e REDIS_HOST=redis://<redis-ip>:6379 tracardi/worker-update\n```\n\nIn this command, replace <redis-ip> with the IP address of the Redis server that Tracardi uses.\n\n### Step 2: Verify that the Worker is Running\n\nAfter running the above command, the import worker will start processing defined data imports, and you can verify that\nthe worker is running by checking the list of running Docker containers using the following command:\n\n```\ndocker ps\n```\n\nIf the worker is not running, check the logs for any errors.\n\n### Step 3: Check Background Tasks\n\nAfter starting the worker, check the background tasks in Tracardi to ensure that the import worker has started\nprocessing the import task. If the import worker did not start processing the task, try creating a new background task.\n\n### Step 4: Troubleshoot Errors\n\nIf you encounter any errors during the import process, refer to the Tracardi documentation or seek help from the \nTracardi community. Common issues that you may encounter include connection errors, malformed data, or unsupported \nfile formats.\n"}
