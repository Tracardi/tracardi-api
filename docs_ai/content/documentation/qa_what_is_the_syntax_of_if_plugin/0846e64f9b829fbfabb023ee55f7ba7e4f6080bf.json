Simple condition with equals operator:\n\n```\npayload@field == \"value\"\n```\n\n2. Complex condition with AND:\n\n```\n(payload@field1 == \"value1\" AND payload@field2 != \"value2\")\n```\n\n3. Complex condition with OR:\n\n```\n(payload@field1 > 10 OR payload@field2 <= 5)\n```\n\n4. BETWEEN condition:\n\n```\npayload@age BETWEEN 18 AND 30\n```\n\n5. IS NULL condition:\n\n```\nsession@user_id IS NULL\n```\n\n6. EXISTS condition:\n\n```\nprofile@email EXISTS\n```\n\n7. NOT EXISTS condition:\n\n```\nmemory@key NOT EXISTS\n```\n\n8. Compound value in a function:\n\n```\nevent@timestamp > datetime(2023-01-01T00:00:00)\n```\n\n9. Empty condition:\n\n```\nflow@details EMPTY\n```\n\n10. Complex condition with nested parentheses:\n\n```\n(payload@field1 == \"value1\" AND (payload@field2 != \"value2\" OR payload@field3 > 0))\n```\n\n11. Complex condition that uses data functions.\n\n```\n(\n    payload@age > 18 AND \n    (\n        event@event_type == \"click\" OR \n        event@properties.action == \"add_to_cart\"\n    ) AND \n    (\n        profile@data.pii.age > 25 AND \n        (\n            event@action == \"purchase\" OR \n            event@properties.action == \"add_to_cart\"\n        )\n    )\n) OR (\n    (\n        payload@quantity BETWEEN 10 AND 50 OR \n        payload@timestamp BETWEEN 1631233200 AND 1631319600\n    ) AND \n    (\n        payload@description IS NULL OR \n        event@type IS NOT NULL\n    ) AND \n    (\n        event@properties.location EXISTS AND \n        profile@address NOT EXISTS\n    )\n) AND (\n    (\n        memory@notes EMPTY OR \n        payload@items NOT EMPTY\n    ) AND \n    (\n        payload@keywords CONTAINS \"technology\" OR \n        event@tags CONTAINS \"important\"\n    )\n) AND (\n    (\n        payload@name STARTS WITH \"John\" OR \n        event@description ENDS WITH \"exciting event\"\n    ) AND \n    (\n        event@participants[0] == \"Alice\" OR \n        event@ratings[2] >= 4.5\n    )\n) AND (\n    now(\"europe/warsaw\") > datetime(\"2021-01-01 00:00:00\") AND \n    now(\"europe/london\") < now.offset(payload@time, \"+700 days\")\n)\n```\n\n12. CONTAINS Condition (contains string):\n\n- Check if keywords in payload contain \"technology\":\n```\n  payload@keywords CONTAINS \"technology\"\n```\n\n- Check if event tags contain the word \"important\":\n```\n  event@tags CONTAINS \"important\"\n```\n\n13. STARTS WITH/ENDS WITH String Conditions:\n\n- Check if payload name starts with \"John\":\n```\n  payload@name STARTS WITH \"John\"\n```\n\n- Check if event description ends with \"exciting event\":\n```\n  event@description ENDS WITH \"exciting event\"\n```\n\nRemember, these examples follow the syntax you provided and assume that the specified fields like `payload@keywords`\n, `event@tags`, `payload@name`, and `event@participants[0]`, etc. exist in the data structure you're working with.\n", "hash": "0846e64f9b829fbfabb023ee55f7ba7e4f6080bf"}
