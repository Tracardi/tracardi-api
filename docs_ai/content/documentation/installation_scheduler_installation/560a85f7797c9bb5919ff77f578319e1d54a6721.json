Certain functionalities within Tracardi,\nsuch as the \"Pause and Resume\", or \"Run In Background\" plugin and any time-based triggers, rely on the Scheduler.\n\nTo successfully run the Scheduler, you will need to set up two Docker containers:\n\n* tracardi/com-tracardi-scheduler-worker: This container processes triggers.\n\n## Starting the Docker Containers\n\nBefore starting the Docker containers, ensure that the container is configured in the same way as\ntracardi/tracardi-api. If the API is set to run as a multi-tenant application, the Scheduler must also be configured\naccordingly.\n\nThe Scheduler does not need to be explicitly set to PRODUCTION=yes or no. The production context is specified in the\ntask description, enabling the Scheduler to connect to the appropriate database.\n\nIf you do not set up the multi-tenancy correctly, you may encounter the following error: \"invalid source.\"\n\nUse the following example Docker command to start the worker container:\n\n```bash\ndocker run \\\n-e ELASTIC_HOST=http://192.168.1.101:9200 \\\n-e REDIS_HOST=192.168.1.101 \\\n-e MULTI_TENANT_MANAGER_URL=http://192.168.1.101:8080 \\\n-e MULTI_TENANT_MANAGER_API_KEY=123 \\\n-e MULTI_TENANT=yes \\\ntracardi/com-tracardi-scheduler-worker:0.8.1-rc3\n```\n\nFor non-multi-tenant setups, use the following Docker command:\n\n```bash\ndocker run \\\n-e ELASTIC_HOST=http://192.168.1.101:9200 \\\n-e REDIS_HOST=192.168.1.101 \\\ntracardi/com-tracardi-scheduler-worker:0.8.1-rc3\n```\n\nPlease ensure that you replace the environment variable values (ELASTIC_HOST, REDIS_HOST, etc.) with the appropriate\nconfigurations for your specific setup.\n", "hash": "560a85f7797c9bb5919ff77f578319e1d54a6721"}
