What is the difference between public and private data in a profile?", "4. How does Tracardi use a graphical editor to aggregate data in a profile?", "5. How does the use of a graphical editor ensure the accuracy of a profile?"], "answer": "# Profile\nA profile refers to a detailed record or representation of a person. The profile contains information about personal\ncharacteristics, interests, and activities. The information is obtained and updated based on incoming events and data\nimported from external systems.\n\nFor instance, Tracardi may collect data from a customer's interaction with a website or other service. These\ninteractions are captured as events, which are assigned to a corresponding profile. This allows Tracardi to maintain a\ndetailed picture of the customer throughout their interaction with the service.\n\nProfile information includes both public and private data. The public data may include actions taken by the user on a\nwebsite, while the private data may include personal information.\n\nIn order to aggregate the collected data in the profile, Tracardi uses a graphical editor. An administrator using\nTracardi can use this editor to define the method by which data from events is attached to the profile. This ensures\nthat the right data is in the right place and that the profile remains up-to-date and accurate.\n", "hash": "01a684d8dec531d0b5c6364962b9a66ed3e20b7f"}
