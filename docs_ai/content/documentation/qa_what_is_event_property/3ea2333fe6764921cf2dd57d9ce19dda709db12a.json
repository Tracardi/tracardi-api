It\ncontains the actual data associated with the event and can vary depending on the nature of the event and the specific\nrequirements of the system or application. Event properties play a crucial role in enriching the event data, allowing\nfor a more detailed and meaningful representation of the event within the system or application.\n\nFor example, event properties can include information about the user involved in the event, such as user ID, username,\nemail address, or any other relevant user identifiers. They can also capture specific aspects of the event, such as\nquantity, price, duration, location, or any other measurable or meaningful attributes. Additionally, event properties\nmay include flags or indicators that reflect the status or outcome of the event, such as success, failure, pending, or\nin-progress. Furthermore, they can contain additional contextual information or metadata that provides further insights\ninto the event, such as event source, event category, or any custom-defined metadata specific to the application or\nsystem.\n", "hash": "3ea2333fe6764921cf2dd57d9ce19dda709db12a"}
