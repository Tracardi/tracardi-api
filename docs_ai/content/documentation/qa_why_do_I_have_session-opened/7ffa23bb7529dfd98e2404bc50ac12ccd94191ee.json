When the first event is collected, Tracardi checks if the\nuser has an existing session. If there is no session associated with the user, Tracardi creates a new one, and this\naction triggers the session-opened event.\n\nSimilarly, this logic is applied to profile and visit events. If there is no existing profile or visit for the user,\nTracardi generates new ones and raises the respective events. This functionality is beneficial as it allows users to\nassociate additional workflows or actions with the event of a session being opened or a new user profile being created.\nThis way, users can implement custom behaviors or processes triggered by these events within the Tracardi platform.\n", "hash": "7ffa23bb7529dfd98e2404bc50ac12ccd94191ee"}
