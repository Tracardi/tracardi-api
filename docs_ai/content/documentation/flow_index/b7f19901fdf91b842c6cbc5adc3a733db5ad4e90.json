Workflow is a series of actions connected into graph. The actions are\nrun one after another to fetch, process, store the data. The actions (sometimes called nodes) may do different things,\nsuch as fetching the data from external databases, storing data in profile, sending data to external services, etc. The\nlist of action nodes is constantly extended.\n\n## Actions\n\nTracardi is an extendable system. It is build in a way that anyone with basic knowledge of python can add new action\nnodes. That's why you can find a lot of plug-ins for Tracardi on the Internet. New actions can be installed on the system simply\nby adding its module name. Tracardi will then download the plugin code and install it. See more about plugins installation \nin plugins section.\n\n### Action configuration\n\nMost of the actions need configuration. It is done by filling the configuration file in JSON format. Most of\nnone-technical user are not familiar with JSON so the action nodes come with plain forms that fill the JSON\nconfiguration automatically after the user saves the data in the form. There is no need for the user to manually edit\nJSON files.\n\nThere are cases when IT personnel wants to inspect the configuration so the JSON file is also visible in the action\nconfiguration in the Graphical User Interface. Information edited in JSON is automatically visible in forms, as well.\n\n### Action documentation\n\nThis manual provides a detailed workflow actions documentation. It documents how to use and configure the plugin. The\ninformation provided shows how to configure the plugin using the JSON configuration file. Configuration via forms should\nbe self-explanatory so there is no additional documentation for this.\n\n## Workflow staging\n\nTracardi automatically saves workflow changes. This means that any change or error in workflow could break the running\nsystem. Therefore, workflows are in 2 different stages. One is production stage. This is the copy of a working workflow. \nThis workflow is running and the data is processed. It can not be changed. The second stage is development stage. This is a copy\nof a workflow that the user is editing. The change in this workflow is saved every 3 seconds. At some point it will become\na production workflow.\n\nChanging the state of the workflow as simple as clicking deploy button on workflow editor. Then current workflow is copied \nto production. The old production workflow is saved in case we need to revoke the deployed workflow for some reason.\n\n## Workflow internal state\n\nWorkflow has an internal state that is referenced in each action node. Please read about actions and the state they \nhold in [Action's Core Definitions](actions/index.md)\n"}
