Both of them are optional, so we have four\ndifferent loading scenarios:\n\n1. If the session exists and the profile exists in the Tracardi database, both the profile and the session are loaded\n   from the database.\n2. If the session exists but the profile does not exist in the database, a new profile is created and saved to the\n   database, and the existing session is loaded.\n3. If the session does not exist but the profile already exists in the database, the existing profile is loaded, and a\n   new session is created and saved in the database.\n4. If neither the session nor the profile exists, then both the session and the profile are created and saved in the\n   database.\n\nError scenarios that may occur:\n\n1. Session and profile are defined, but the profile does not exist in the database. The result of this operation is that\n   the saved session in the database will reference the old profile, which will be restored.\n2. Session and profile are defined, but the session does not exist in the database. The result of this operation is that\n   a new session will be created.\n3. Session and profile are defined. The session does not exist in the database, and although the profile is defined, it\n   also does not exist in the database. Attempt to fake the profile ID. The result of this operation is that a new\n   session and a new profile will be created.\n\nDevice Fingerprinting:\n\nDevice Fingerprinting is activated when using the \"Javascript integration\" event source. This means that when\nintegrating with JavaScript, actions related to Device Fingerprinting are performed to identify a unique device (e.g.,\ncomputer, phone) used by the user. The identification is based on device characteristics and behaviors, such as the\nbrowser, screen resolution, operating system version, and more.\n\nMatching customers based on device fingerprint is restricted by the customer's IP address and the time they access the\nsystem. If the device, IP address, and time range match, the customer will be associated with the same profile, even if\nthe new webpage does not have the customer's profile ID saved. This ensures that the system can still correctly\nrecognize and link the customer's data based on the matching device fingerprint, IP address, and time range, even if the\nprofile ID is not available.\n\nMoreover, if the customer visits a new page that already has a profile ID from their previous browsing session, the\nsystem will match the customer with the saved profile ID. The system will not merge the profiles unless the event source\nis configured to allow merging using the device fingerprint. In other words, if there is an existing profile ID\nassociated with the customer, the system will prioritize using that ID instead of merging it with the device\nfingerprint, unless the event source specifically permits merging based on the device fingerprint. This approach ensures\nbetter control and accuracy in associating customer data and prevents unintended merging of profiles when it is not\ndesired.\n", "hash": "27a876c75d67289eaa80a9966994b7a6f300a442"}
