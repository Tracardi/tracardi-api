It includes\npertinent details that help to better understand the circumstances surrounding the event. The specific content of event\ncontext can vary depending on the nature of the event and the requirements of the system or application.\n\nEvent context serves to enrich the event data with supplementary metadata that offers a wider perspective on the event's\noccurrence. This additional data can take the form of contextual tags, event categories, or any custom contextual\ninformation specific to the application or system. It allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the event's\nsignificance and its relationship to other events or processes within the system.\n\nIn essence, event context provides background information that gives meaning and relevance to the event, facilitating\nbetter analysis, tracking, and decision-making within the system or application.\n", "hash": "099ac8884ec968845ffc7e5bc51fdcbea54be919"}
