How do minor upgrades differ from major upgrades? ", "3. What are the key characteristics of minor upgrades? ", "4. What are the key characteristics of major upgrades?"], "answer": "# What are the differences between major and minor upgrades\nThe main differences between minor and major upgrades can be summarized as follows:\n\nMinor Upgrades:\n\n1. Changes: Minor upgrades involve updates that do not require modifications to the underlying database structure.\n2. Version Number: Minor upgrades are indicated by a change in the last number of the version. For example, going from\n   version 1.2.0.1 to 1.2.0.1.\n3. Data Migration: Minor upgrades generally do not require data migration or schema updates.\n4. Compatibility: Minor upgrades are designed to ensure backward compatibility, meaning that the system will continue to\n   work as it did before the upgrade.\n\nMajor Upgrades:\n\n1. Changes: Major upgrades involve substantial changes, including modifications to the underlying database structure.\n2. Version Number: Major upgrades are indicated by a change in a number other than the last one in the version. For\n   example, going from version 2.0.0 to 3.0.0 or 0.8.0 rto 0.8.1.\n3. Data Migration: Major upgrades often require data migration or schema updates to align the existing data with the new\n   version.\n4. Upgrade Process: Major upgrades typically involve a more involved process, including running two copies of the\n   system (old and new) and migrating the data from the old version to the new version.\n5. Compatibility: Major upgrades may introduce backward-incompatible changes, meaning that the system may require\n   additional steps and effort to ensure that existing functionalities and data work correctly with the new version.\n\nIn summary, minor upgrades involve smaller updates that do not require significant changes to the system's database\nstructure. Major upgrades, on the other hand, encompass substantial changes, including modifications to the database\nstructure, and often require data migration and careful planning to ensure a smooth transition to the new version.\n", "hash": "023fcdb3c40bdd40c1e4c7209834391c1992af87"}
