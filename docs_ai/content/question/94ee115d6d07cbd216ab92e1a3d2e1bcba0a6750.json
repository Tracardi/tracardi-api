By 2011, DNT had been adopted by all the major browsers, but it\u2019s not enforceable. That means its default\nvalue is set to track the user.\n\nYou can respect the browser setting and do not to track the user. If you decide to do this Tracardi will not load the\ntracking script if the user sets DNT. To respect the DNT set `respectDoNotTrack: true`\nin settings section of tracker options.\n\n```javascript title=\"Example\" linenums=\"1\" hl_lines=\"10-12\"\n    const options = {\n      tracker: {\n        url: {\n            script: 'http://localhost:8686/tracker',\n            api: 'http://localhost:8686'\n        },\n        source: {\n            id: \"3ee63fc6-490a-4fd8-bfb3-bf0c8c8d3387\"\n        },\n        settings: {\n          respectDoNotTrack: true\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIf the `respectDoNotTrack` is missing in the settings than Tracardi sets default setting and loads tracking script.\n"}
