Event validation can be configured in the Tracardi GUI or via the API. The endpoints\nresponsible for creating the validation schemes are located at the following endpoints:\n\n| Method      | Path                                  |                                             |\n| ----------- | --------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| `GET`       | /event/management                     | Add event metadata and validation schema    |\n| `DELETE`    | /event/management/{event_type}        | Delete event metadata and validation schema |\n| `GET`       | /event/management                     | List event metadata with validation schemas |\n\nAs always, complete API documentation is available at:\n\n```\nhttp://tracardi-host:8686/docs\n```\n\n## New event validation schema\n\nTo add new event validation schema that you will need to provide a Json Schema object that defines the model of event,\nor event session or loaded profile.\n\nValidator consist of 2 elements. Data to be validated - expressed in a [dotted notation](../notations/dot_notation.md), and a\njson schema itself.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"event@properties\": {\n    ...json-schema\n  },\n  \"profile@traits.my-data\": {\n    ...json-schema\n  }\n}\n```\n\n*Real example* - for event@properties\n\n```json\n{\n  \"validation\": {\n    \"json_schema\": {\n      \"event@properties\": {\n        \"type\": \"object\",\n        \"properties\": {\n          \"price\": {\n            \"type\": \"number\"\n          },\n          \"name\": {\n            \"type\": \"string\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"required\": [\n          \"name\"\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"event_type\": \"test\"\n}\n```\n\n## Validation caching\n\nValidation is cached and the default Time To Live for cache is 180 seconds. It means that validation schema will stay\nthe same for 3 minutes even if it was change by the user. It will be red again after 180 seconds. To make the period\nlonger or shorter, run Tracardi with environment variable EVENT_VALIDATOR_TTL set to the number of seconds you would\nlike the system to cache the validation.\n\n## Validation errors\n\nIf the validations do not pass, an error 406 - NOT ACCEPTABLE status is returned with the information on the reason why\nthe validation did not pass.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"detail\": \"Validation failed with error: event@properties: 'name' is a required property....\"\n}\n```\n"}
