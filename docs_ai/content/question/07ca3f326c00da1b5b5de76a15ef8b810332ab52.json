{"file_name": "docs/installation/source/index.md", "questions": ["What is the command to start Elasticsearch as a docker container?", "How to start Elasticsearch as a docker container?", "What is the command to start Redis as a docker container?", "How to start Redis as a docker container?"], "answer": "# Set the bind address to a specific IP (IPv4 or IPv6):#\nnetwork.host: localhost\n```\n\nWe have specified localhost so that Elasticsearch listens on all interfaces and bound IPs. If you want it to listen only\non a specific interface, you can specify its IP in place of localhost. Save and close elasticsearch.yml. If you\u2019re using\nnano, you can do so by pressing CTRL+X, followed by Y and then ENTER .\n\nThese are the minimum settings you can start with in order to use Elasticsearch. Now you can start Elasticsearch for the\nfirst time.\n\nStart the Elasticsearch service with systemctl. Give Elasticsearch a few moments to start up. Otherwise, you may get\nerrors about not being able to connect.\n\n```bash\nsudo systemctl start elasticsearch\n```\n\n### Testing elasticsearch\n\nBy now, Elasticsearch should be running on port 9200. You can test it with cURL and a GET request.\n\n```\ncurl -X GET 'http://localhost:9200'\n```\n\nYou should see the following response:\n\n```\n{\n  \"name\" : \"localhost\",\n  \"cluster_name\" : \"elasticsearch\",\n  \"cluster_uuid\" : \"XHATygZ4R1C59dEXDUs-og\",\n  \"version\" : {\n    \"number\" : \"7.17.0\",\n    \"build_flavor\" : \"default\",\n    \"build_type\" : \"deb\",\n    \"build_hash\" : \"bee86328705acaa9a6daede7140defd4d9ec56bd\",\n    \"build_date\" : \"2022-01-28T08:36:04.875279988Z\",\n    \"build_snapshot\" : false,\n    \"lucene_version\" : \"8.11.1\",\n    \"minimum_wire_compatibility_version\" : \"6.8.0\",\n    \"minimum_index_compatibility_version\" : \"6.0.0-beta1\"\n  },\n  \"tagline\" : \"You Know, for Search\"\n}\n```\n\nIf you see a response similar to the one above, Elasticsearch is working properly. If not, make sure that you have\nfollowed the installation instructions correctly and you have allowed some time for Elasticsearch to fully start.\n\n\n## Elasticsearch as a docker container\n\nOpen a terminal and enter:\n\n```\ndocker run -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 -e \"discovery.type=single-node\" docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.13.2\n\n``` \n\nYou have run a single instance of elasticsearch in the console. When you want to stop it, press CTRL + C\n\n!!! Tip\n\n    If you want elasticsearch to run in the background, type: \n    `docker run -d -p 9200: 9200 -p 9300: 9300 -e \"discovery.type = single-node\" docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.13.2`\n\n#### Redis\n\nYou will need a redis instance as well. \n\nStart it with:\n\n```\ndocker run -p 6379:6379 redis\n```"}
