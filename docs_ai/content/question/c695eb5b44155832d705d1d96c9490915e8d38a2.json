{"file_name": "docs/getting_started/tracking.md", "questions": ["What is customer tracking and identity resolution?", "What is a session ID?", "What is a profile ID?"], "answer": "# Customer tracking\nCustomer tracking and identity resolution are techniques used to monitor the behavior of customers on a website or\nmobile app and to combine the data collected from different devices and sessions to create a complete profile of the\ncustomer.\n\nIn Tracardi, a session is established when a user opens a browser or mobile app, and each click or event is recorded and\nsent to a server. The session ID is a unique identifier generated on the client side (e.g. web browser) and stored in\ncookies. It remains the same for the time the browser is opened. A new session ID is created only when the browser or\napp is closed and reopened.\n\nOn the other hand, the profile ID is a unique identifier for a user profile that is created when the user interacts with\nthe website or app. It is generated by Tracardi, and it remains the same throughout the whole user's journey. It is\nstored in local storage of the browser.\n\n!!! Notice\n\n    Each browser/device will have its own profile ID. Profile ID is attached to the browser and can be merged into single \n    profile during identity resolution."}
