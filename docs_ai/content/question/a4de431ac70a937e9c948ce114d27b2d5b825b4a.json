It must match the source ID that is defined in Tracardi.\n  Otherwise, the system will return an \"Unauthorized Access\" response.\n* __session.id__ - it is a UUID generated and saved on the client's side. Whenever the session changes or a new customer\n  visit starts, a new session ID is generated.\n* __profile.id__ - this is the UUID of the profile ID. The profile ID must remain unchanged during the entire customer\n  journey. The profile ID is generated on the server side. When the first event is sent to Tracardi, the system will\n  return a generated profile ID that needs to be saved by the client (browser or mobile device) and resent with each\n  subsequent event. Tracardi has several algorithms that try to keep the profile ID unchanged during the entire customer\n  journey. Some of those algorithms will be described below.\n* __context__ - this is a JSON data that describes the context of the event. It can be an agent type, e.g. mobile app\n  name, service name. This part is defined by the user.\n* __events__ - this is a collection of event objects that consist of: type, properties, context, and options. See below\n  for more details.\n* __options__ - this is a key-value store for additional options.\n\nTracardi can collect several events in one request. That's why we define a list of objects in the events key. Each event\nmay have different context and can also inherit values from the tracker payload. Here's an example of the tracker\npayload that could be sent to Tracardi.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"source\": {\n    \"id\": \"3ee63fc6-490a-4fd8-bfb3-bf0c8c8d3387\"\n  },\n  \"session\": {\n    \"id\": \"bfb3-bf0c8c8d3387-3ee63fc6-490a-4fd8\"\n  },\n  \"profile\": {\n    \"id\": \"bf0c8c8d3387-3ee63fc6-490a-4fd8bfb3\"\n  },\n  \"context\": {\n    \"system\": \"webstore-backend\",\n    \"webstore\": {\n      \"url\": \"http://magento-store.com\",\n      \"name\": \"Shoe store\"\n    },\n    \"client\": {\n      \"browser\": \"Mozilla Firefox\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"properties\": {},\n  \"events\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"page-view\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"pageTitle\": \"My Page\"\n      },\n      \"options\": {\n        \"saveEvent\": false,\n        \"saveSession\": false,\n        \"debugger\": false\n      },\n      \"context\": {\n        \"tag\": \"product-details-page\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"consent-granted\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"marketing\": false,\n        \"general\": true\n      },\n      \"options\": {\n        \"profile\": true,\n        \"saveSession\": false\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"product-in-basket\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"product\": \"Adidas sneakers\",\n        \"price\": 34.43\n      },\n      \"options\": {\n        \"profile\": false,\n        \"logs\": false\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"options\": {}\n}\n```\n\nThis is a full-fledged tracker payload with a lot of data. But not all the fields are required.\n\nThe required fields are:\n\n* `source.id`, `session.id`, `profile.id` - if exists, and collection of `events`\n\nMinimalistic tracker payload could look like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"source\": {\n    \"id\": \"f14dc4b1-8dd8-4fc1-bd14-d6823ba7013e\"\n  },\n  \"session\": {\n    \"id\": \"d6823ba7013e-8dd8-4fc1-bd14-f14dc4b1\"\n  },\n  \"events\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"page-view\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"pageTitle\": \"My Page\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"consent-granted\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"marketing\": false,\n        \"general\": true\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"product-in-basket\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"product\": \"Adidas sneakers\",\n        \"price\": 34.43\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"}
