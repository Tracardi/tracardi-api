If an admin password is weak or easily guessed, it could be exploited by attackers or unauthorized individuals, who could gain access to sensitive data or disrupt the system's operation.\n\nBy setting a strong admin password, you can help to prevent unauthorized access and protect the security and integrity of the system or application. This can help to ensure that your data and systems are safe from unauthorized access and tampering, and that you can trust the security and reliability of your system or application.\n\n\n## Separation of track server and API\n\n## Running workers\n"}
