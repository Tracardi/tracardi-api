They can, however, be installed\nwith APT after adding Elastic\u2019s package source list.\n\nAll of the packages are signed with the Elasticsearch signing key in order to protect your system from package spoofing.\nPackages which have been authenticated using the key will be considered trusted by your package manager. In this step,\nyou will import the Elasticsearch public GPG key and add the Elastic package source list in order to install\nElasticsearch.\n\nTo begin, use cURL, the command line tool for transferring data with URLs, to import the Elasticsearch public GPG key\ninto APT. Note that we are using the arguments -fsSL to silence all progress and possible errors (except for a server\nfailure) and to allow cURL to make a request on a new location if redirected. Pipe the output of the cURL command into\nthe apt-key program, which adds the public GPG key to APT.\n\nOpen a terminal and enter:\n\n```\ncurl -fsSL https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | sudo apt-key add -\n```\n\nNext, add the Elastic source list to the sources.list.d directory, where APT will look for new sources:\n\n```\necho \"deb https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/7.x/apt stable main\" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-7.x.list\n```\n\nNext, update your package lists so APT will read the new Elastic source:\n\n```\nsudo apt update\n```\n\nThen install Elasticsearch with this command:\n\n```\nsudo apt install elasticsearch\n```\n\nElasticsearch is now installed and ready to be configured.\n\n### Elasticsearch configuration\n\nTo configure Elasticsearch, we will edit its main configuration file elasticsearch.yml where most of its configuration\noptions are stored. This file is located in the /etc/elasticsearch directory.\n\nUse your preferred text editor to edit Elasticsearch\u2019s configuration file. Here, we\u2019ll use nano:\n\n```\nsudo nano /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml\n```\n\n!!! Note\n\n    Elasticsearch\u2019s configuration file is in YAML format, which means that we need to maintain the indentation format. \n    Be sure that you do not add any extra spaces as you edit this file.\n\nThe elasticsearch.yml file provides configuration options for your cluster, node, paths, memory, network, discovery, and\ngateway. Most of these options are preconfigured in the file but you can change them according to your needs. For the\npurposes of our demonstration of a single-server configuration, we will only adjust the settings for the network host.\n\nElasticsearch listens for traffic from everywhere on port 9200. You will want to restrict outside access to your\nElasticsearch instance to prevent outsiders from reading your data or shutting down your Elasticsearch cluster through\nits [REST API] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer). To restrict access and therefore\nincrease security, find the line that specifies network.host, uncomment it, and replace its value with localhost, so it\nlooks like this:\n\n```"}
