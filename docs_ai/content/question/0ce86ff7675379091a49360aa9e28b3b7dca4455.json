The JavaScript\nsnippet automates the process of calling the track endpoint and saving the Session ID and Profile ID in the browser.\n\nHowever, when integrating with mobile apps or backend systems, the process needs to be done manually. It is crucial to\nremember that both the Profile ID and Session ID must be saved on the customer's device or backend system for effective\ntracking and personalization.\n\nWhile it may be evident to save the Profile ID and Session ID when integrating with a mobile app, it may not be as\napparent when integrating with a PHP application or other server-side applications. In such cases, it is necessary to\nset a PHPSESSIONID or other relevant token that can be used to track the customer and store the Tracardi Profile ID and\nSession ID within the defined user session. This ensures that the data collected by Tracardi can be accurately\nassociated with the correct customer profile and used for further personalization or analysis.\n\nIt is essential to follow these steps diligently when integrating Tracardi with mobile apps or external systems to\nensure seamless tracking and utilization of customer data for effective marketing automation and personalization."}
