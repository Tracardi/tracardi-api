Copy this key to\n  the Token field in the Tracardi form.\n\n* __Verify the API key__: If you encounter an error stating that the API key is invalid, double-check that you have set the\n  correct API key from Mailchimp.\n* __Check API key configuration__: Make sure you have followed the tutorial for finding and setting the API key correctly.\n  The API key should match the one generated in your Mailchimp account.\n\n* __Save API key__: If you are unable to change the API key and it does not get saved, try disabling the resource and then\n  enabling it again. This may help in saving the updated API key.\n\n* __Troubleshooting__: If the issue persists, reach out to the plugin developer or support team to investigate the error and\n  find a solution.\n\nAdditionally, as an alternative solution, you can consider using the SMTP mailer in Tracardi to send emails. This can be\nhelpful if you continue to encounter difficulties with the Mailchimp integration.\n\n## How to send email only once\n\nRegarding triggering emails only once for the same event and user, you can achieve this by saving information about the\nsent email in the user's profile. For example, after sending an email, use the \"Copy Data\" action in Tracardi to set a\nflag in the profile (e.g., profile@aux.sent_email = 1). Before triggering the email, you can check this flag to determine\nif the email has already been sent for a specific event.\n\nRemember, it's important to save and utilize the necessary information in the profile to conditionally send emails and\navoid duplicate sends based on specific events or user actions.\n\nIf you need further assistance, don't hesitate to seek help from Tracardi support or consult with the Tracardi\ncommunity.\n"}
