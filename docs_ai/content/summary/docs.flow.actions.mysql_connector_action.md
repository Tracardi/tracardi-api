This documentation is about the Mysql Connector plugin which connects to Mysql and executes a SQL query. It is configured with a source resource containing MySQL credentials, a type of query, a query statement, data to replace in the statement, and a timeout. The output is returned in JSON format and will vary depending on the type of query. If the query is of insert type, the output will have the last inserted record id. If the query is of type "delete","update", or "create" then the output result will have the input payload. If an error is raised, it is usually due to the number of %s placeholders and data not matching.
