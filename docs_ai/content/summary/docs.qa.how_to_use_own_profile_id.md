The commercial bridge method is a bit more complicated, but it allows you to use your own profile ID without having to
copy it to the profile's "ids" property. This method involves setting up a bridge between the collector and the profile
ID. The bridge will then take the profile ID and pass it to the collector, allowing you to use your own profile ID.
It's important to note that this method requires a commercial bridge, so it may not be suitable for everyone.

Overall, Tracardi allows users to set their own profile ID in two ways. The open source method involves passing the profile
ID in properties, copying it to profile IDs in a workflow, and storing it in the profile's "ids" property. The commercial
bridge method involves setting up a bridge between the collector and the profile ID, allowing the profile ID to be passed
to the collector. Both methods require careful consideration to ensure that the profile ID is secure and not exposed to
the internet.
