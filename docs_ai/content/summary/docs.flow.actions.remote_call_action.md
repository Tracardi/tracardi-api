This plugin is used to make remote calls to an API. It is configured with a JSON object that includes the method (POST or GET), source (the ID and name of the API resource), endpoint, timeout, headers, cookies, sslCheck, and body. The body can be sent as a JSON object or as a flattened set of parameters. The plugin also supports dot paths in the cookie headers and body, which can be replaced with current workflow values. The plugin returns either the response or an error on the response or error port, respectively. The response is a JSON object that includes the status, content, and cookies.
