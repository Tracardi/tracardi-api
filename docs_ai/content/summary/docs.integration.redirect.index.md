Inbound Traffic/Event Redirects is a feature that allows you to redirect traffic from specific links to a defined URL, while sending an event to Tracardi. This feature is useful for tracking user activity and providing additional information about the redirect. Setting up Inbound Traffic/Event Redirects involves defining the links that you want to redirect, setting the target URL, defining the event properties, and setting up the event tracking in Tracardi. Once the setup is complete, when a user clicks on one of the defined links, they will be redirected to the target URL and an event will be sent to Tracardi. 

The redirect links are in the form of http://<tracardi-api-url>/redirect/<redirect-id>, where the tracardi-api-url is the url to Tracardi API server and the redirect-id is the id of the redirection. All redirect links are available at Inbound Traffic/Event redirects, and clicking on the selected row will show the full url path.
