The Pushover plugin is a plugin that sends a message to the Pushover service. To use this plugin, you must first register at https://pushover.net and obtain an API_TOKEN and USER_KEY. This plugin requires access to a resource that will hold the PushOver credentials. The resource configuration requires a JSON object with the token and user key. The plugin configuration requires a source object with the name and id of the resource, as well as a message template that uses placeholders for data from the profile. This plugin does not take any input, and the output returns the status and response body from the PushOver service. The response body is a JSON object with the status and request.
