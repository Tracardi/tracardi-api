FullContact.com is an Identity Resolution Platform that allows users to resolve and enrich people by submitting any identifiers they already have, such as a personal email address, work email address, phone number, name and home address, social ID, social URL and social username (except Facebook and Instagram). In order to use FullContact, users must obtain an API_KEY that will allow them to access FullContact API. This can be done by registering on fullcontact.com and following the steps on the page.

The configuration for FullContact requires a resource-id that points to the FullContact API key. The pii data does not need to include all the data from the example, it is ok to provide only an e-mail or phone. The more data provided, the better as FullContact will be able to match the person more precisely. The input for this action does not require a payload, and the output will return the response data on the payload port if the connection to FullContact was successful. If not, the payload port will be inactive and the error message will be returned on the error port. An example of a successful response on the payload port is provided.
