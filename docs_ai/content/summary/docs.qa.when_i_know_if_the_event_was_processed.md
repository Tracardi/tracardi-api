The documentation text provides information about how to know if an event has been processed. It states that the status of the event will change from "collected" (blue) to "processed" (green). If there are no additional statuses such as errors or warnings, then it indicates that the event has been successfully processed. This is a useful piece of information for anyone who is trying to track the progress of their event. It can help them to know when their event has been processed and can provide peace of mind that their event is being handled correctly.
