This documentation provides a list of services/dockers for a production-ready Tracardi installation. The services include the Collector API, Production API, Staging API, Scheduler, Scheduler Worker, Segmentation Job, Segmentation Worker, Update and Migration, and Bridges. 

The Collector API is the API that should be exposed to the internet and is limited to collecting data only. Access to the Production API is restricted and limited to authorized users only, and access to the Staging API is restricted to personnel working on data orchestration. The Scheduler is responsible for rescheduling the execution of delayed events, and the Scheduler Worker is responsible for executing the delayed events. The Segmentation Job runs periodically and checks for profiles that need to be run through the segmentation process, and the Segmentation Worker is responsible for running the defined segmentation process. The Update and Migration workers are responsible for various tasks such as system migration and data import, and the Bridges collect data from different channels and bridge the transportation protocol to the tracardi event source.
