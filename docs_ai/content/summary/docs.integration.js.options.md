The Tracardi JavaScript snippet allows developers to configure the behavior of events and add contextual information associated with an event. The default event context attached by the Tracardi JavaScript snippet includes the page URL, path, hash, title, referer information (host and query), and browsing history length, as well as the IP address of the user. Developers can also customize the event context by including a "context" key in the options when triggering events. This allows developers to include additional information that is relevant to their specific use case. 

Beacon events in Tracardi are events that are sent even if the customer leaves the page. To configure a beacon event in Tracardi, developers can add the asBeacon: true option to the track configuration. This indicates that the event should be sent as a beacon event. Beacon events can be useful in scenarios where developers want to track user interactions that may occur outside of the webpage, such as form submissions, button clicks, or other events that may happen after the user has navigated away from the page.
