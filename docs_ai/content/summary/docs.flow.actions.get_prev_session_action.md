This plugin allows users to access previous sessions of their current profile. It takes any payload as input and returns two outputs, found and not_found. The offset parameter is an integer between -10 and 0 inclusively, where 0 is the current session, -1 is the last session, and so on. Advanced configuration allows users to specify the number of the wanted session, counting from the current one. This plugin is useful for users who need to access information from previous sessions, such as data that was entered into a form.
