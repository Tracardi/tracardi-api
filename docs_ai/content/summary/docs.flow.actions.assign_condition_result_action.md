This plugin is designed to assign condition results to profile fields. It takes any payload as input and returns the same payload on port **payload** without any changes. The plugin configuration consists of two parts: form fields and JSON configuration. The form fields section contains key-value pairs, where the key is a path to a field in the profile, and the value is a condition to be resolved. Every key must start with 'profile@'. The JSON configuration provides an example of how the conditions should be set up. The example includes two conditions, one for the profile@consents.marketing-consent field and one for the profile@interests.computers field. The first condition checks if the profile@consents.marketing field exists, while the second condition checks if the session@context.browser.url is equal to "http://computers.com". This plugin is useful for assigning condition results to profile fields in order to ensure that the correct data is stored in the profile.
