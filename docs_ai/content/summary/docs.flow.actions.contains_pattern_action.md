This plugin is designed to check if a data field contains a selected pattern. It can match a single pattern for the entire string or search for all the patterns in the given string. The user can select the option "ALL" to look for patterns in the text regardless of whether the pattern is inside the text or the whole text contains the pattern. If the user selects a single pattern, the plugin will search for the pattern and will only return its value if the entire text contains the pattern. For example, if the string "My email is email@email.com" is given and the single email pattern is selected, the string will not be matched as it contains other information besides the email. 

The plugin requires a JSON configuration, which includes the field and pattern to be searched. The available patterns are URL, IP, date, email, and all. If the single pattern option is selected, the plugin will return the found pattern on port TRUE or FALSE if no pattern is found. If the multiple pattern option is selected, the plugin will return the found patterns in a JSON format. For example, the output for a single pattern match would be {"email": ["test@test.com"]}, and the output for a multiple pattern match would be {"date": ["2022-01-01"], "email": ["test@test.com", "admin@admin.com"]}.
