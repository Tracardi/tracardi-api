This documentation describes the event "Checkout Started" which should be used when a customer initiates the checkout process. Examples of when this event should be used include when a user clicks on the "Checkout" button in their shopping cart, when they select the "Checkout" option after adding items to their cart, or when they manually navigate to the checkout page.

The documentation also outlines the expected properties of the event, which are all optional. These properties include a coupon, value, id, order_id, and currency. Additionally, the documentation explains how auto indexing can be used to make data easier to find by creating a structure that organizes the data. This structure is made by copying information from the different parts of the data and putting it into a specific format that can be used to analyze and group the data. The table in the documentation outlines which event property will be copied to event traits.

Finally, the documentation states that data will not be copied to the profile and provides a JSON example of the event properties.
