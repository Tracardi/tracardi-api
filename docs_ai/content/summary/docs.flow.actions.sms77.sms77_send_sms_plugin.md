This plugin allows users to send SMS messages using the Sms77 gateway. It takes any payload as input and returns a response from the Sms77 API on the response port, or an optional error on the error port if one occurs. The JSON configuration contains of resource, message, recipient, and sender. The message is a message template, which means that template placeholders can be used. For example, if the message is "Hello {{profile@pii.name}}, your order will be dispatched in next two hours.", the recipient will see "Hello John, your order will be dispatched in next two hours." in their SMS. The sender can be left blank to use the default Sms77 sender, or a custom sender phone number or name can be set in the Sms77 system and pasted into the plugin. The recipient can be pointed from the profile (default value comes from profile@pii.telephone) or it can be a static phone number.
