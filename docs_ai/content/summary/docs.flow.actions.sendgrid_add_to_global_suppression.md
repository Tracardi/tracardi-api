This plugin allows users to add a contact to Sendgrid, based on the provided data. The plugin takes any payload as input and returns a response from the Sendgrid API on the response port, or an optional error info on the error port if one occurs. The plugin requires two pieces of information to be configured: a Token resource and an email address. The Token resource should contain a Sendgrid Client API key, and the email address should be the path to the email address of the contact. The plugin also requires a JSON configuration, which includes the ID and name of the Token resource, as well as the path to the email address of the contact.
