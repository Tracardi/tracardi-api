This documentation provides information about the Scheduler, a tool that allows users to schedule and postpone events. It explains how to configure and set up the Scheduler, as well as the dependencies it requires. 

To configure the Scheduler, users must define the Tracardi API URL where they want to send the event. This is done by typing the URL into the Schedule settings. The Scheduler uses Redis to schedule the events. 

The Scheduler is a useful tool for automating tasks, such as sending messages to customers after they end their visit on a website. It is a powerful tool that can be used to streamline processes and save time.
