This plugin sends event to google analytics and is configured using a JSON configuration. The configuration requires a category, action, and label. The category is used to organize events into groups, the action tells you what a visitor did, and the label gives more information about the event. An optional value can also be assigned to the event, which is useful for assigning monetary values to events. The output of the plugin is a status code and response content in a JSON schema.
