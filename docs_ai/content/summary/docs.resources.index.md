This documentation text provides information about resources that can be used to query external services for data. It also explains that credentials are needed to connect to the resource and that they are stored in Tracardi and can be referenced in Workflow. Additionally, the part of the resource definition that contains sensitive data is encrypted. Lastly, the text explains that credentials are subject to caching, meaning that after they are changed, the change will not be seen immediately, but after a certain number of seconds. This number of seconds is usually 60 seconds, and more information on cache settings can be found by searching for `SOURCE_CACHE_TTL`.
