The documentation file provides information about upgrading Tracardi, a workflow automation platform. It explains that
it is recommended to wait until Tracardi reaches version 1.0 before upgrading, as this will ensure a smoother upgrade
process. It also provides instructions on how to upgrade to the latest development version, as well as how to migrate
data between versions. It also provides a warning about potential data loss when upgrading minor or development
versions, and a warning about reaching the Elasticsearch limit of 1000 indices. Finally, it provides instructions on how
to delete old indices if necessary.
