This plugin allows users to write data to a cross-instance Tracardi user memory, using a given key and value path. In order for this plugin to work, a Redis database must be installed and running. This plugin takes any payload as input and returns a payload on the success port if the value was successfully written to memory, or an error detail on the error port if one occurred. 

The configuration for this plugin includes a key, which is the name of the variable that will hold the saved data, a value, which can be any string or reference to data inside the workflow, and a time to live, which is the number of seconds after which the value will be deleted. Additionally, there is an advanced configuration option which allows users to specify a key to value in memory, a path to value, and a time to live of the value in JSON format.
