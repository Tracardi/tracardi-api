This plugin is used to update a contact from HubSpot, based on provided data. It takes any payload as input and returns response from HubSpot API on port response, or optional error info on port error if one occurs. In order to use this plugin, you need to create an app in a HubSpot account. You need your apikey/accesstoken and you should choose all the following scopes: crm.objects.companies.write, crm.objects.companies.read, crm.objects.contacts.write, crm.schemas.contacts.read, content. The plugin can be configured with a form or with a JSON configuration. With the form, you need to select your HubSpot resource, provide the contact id and add properties for the contact. With the JSON configuration, you need to provide the access token, contact id and properties for the contact. It is important to use field aliases from HubSpot. Although the plugin updates a contact, HubSpotAPI sometimes returns an unknown error.
