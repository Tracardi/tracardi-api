This documentation explains how to configure the Profile Segmentation action. It outlines the configuration options, which include true_segment, true_action, false_segment, false_action, and condition. The true_segment and false_segment are the segment names that will be added or removed from the profile when the condition is met or not met, respectively. The true_action and false_action are the actions that will be performed when the condition is met or not met, respectively. The condition is the condition that must be met for the profile to be added or removed from the segment. This action does not process input and will return the input payload.
