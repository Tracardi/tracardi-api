This documentation provides instructions on how to integrate the Intercom widget into a web page. The first step is to open an account at www.intercom.com. Once the account is set up, the user will need to find their app_id, which is located in the URL of the Intercom application dashboard. The app_id is then used to set up the plugin. This plugin will inject the Intercom widget into the web page, allowing users to interact with the application. The integration of the Intercom widget into the web page will enable users to access the features of the application, such as messaging, customer support, and analytics.
