This plugin is a value switch that works similarly to an if-then-else statement. It takes any payload object as input and compares the statement value to all the defined key values. If the statement value matches one of the key values, the corresponding value is returned. The configuration for this plugin requires a value and a set of data defined in the switch property. The value contains the statement value, which will be compared to all the key values defined in the switch. If the statement value is a reference to a value, it will be evaluated first and the referenced value will be used as the statement value. If none of the values are equal to the statement value, null is returned. An example of the configuration and result is provided in the documentation.
