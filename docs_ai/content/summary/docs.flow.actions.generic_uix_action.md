This plugin provides a way to integrate custom UIX widgets into a web page. The JavaScript code for the widget can be placed on any web server and the plugin will take care of the rest. The configuration for the plugin is written in JSON and includes the URL of the UIX source code and a mapping of props. The props mapping is used to map the props of the widget to the props of the plugin. This allows the plugin to pass the necessary data to the widget. The plugin also provides a way to customize the widget's appearance and behavior.
