This documentation provides instructions on how to send emails with Mailchimp in Tracardi. It outlines the steps to obtain the API key from Mailchimp, verify the API key, check the API key configuration, and save the API key. Additionally, it provides troubleshooting tips and an alternative solution to consider if difficulties persist. 

The documentation also provides guidance on how to trigger emails only once for the same event and user. It suggests saving information about the sent email in the user's profile and using the "Copy Data" action in Tracardi to set a flag in the profile. This flag can then be checked before triggering the email to determine if the email has already been sent for a specific event. Finally, it encourages users to seek help from Tracardi support or consult with the Tracardi community if further assistance is needed.
