## Custom event types

In addition to the pre-built event types, Tracardi also allows users to create custom event types. This feature is
available in the commercial version and allows users to define their own event types and properties.

When creating a custom event type, users can specify which properties to copy and which to ignore. This allows for
greater control over the data that is collected and stored in the profiles. Additionally, users can also define
conditions for when the data should be copied, such as when a certain event occurs or when a certain property is
present.
