The Workflow Editor in Tracardi is a powerful tool for processing data. It allows users to create a workflow by dragging
and dropping nodes onto the canvas, connecting them, and configuring them. To open the Workflow Editor, users can click
on the icon in the top right corner of the screen. On the left side of the screen, users can search for nodes by typing
their names. To connect nodes, users can select the node they want to connect and drag an edge to the next node. Nodes
have forms that users can fill out to configure how they work. After configuring the nodes, users can save the workflow
and deploy it to production. Some nodes have additional documentation that users can access by clicking on them. Nodes
also have input and output ports that users can click on to see additional documentation. Users can access advanced
runtime settings by double-clicking on a node.

To delete a node in the workflow editor, users can select the node they want to delete and press the Delete key on their
keyboard. To select multiple nodes, users can hold the SHIFT key and click and hold the left mouse button anywhere in
the canvas area. To delete a connection, users can select the connection they want to delete and press the DELETE key on
their keyboard.
