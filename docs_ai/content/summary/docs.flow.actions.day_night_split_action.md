This plugin is designed to split the workflow depending on the time of day or night of its execution. It requires configuration in order to read the longitude and latitude of the event, which must be provided in dot notation. The input payload is not processed, and the output consists of two ports - one for day and one for night - which will return the input payload. The active output port will depend on the time of day or night of the event.
