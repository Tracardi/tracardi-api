The documentation text provides information about Elasticsearch's sniffing feature. Sniffing is a feature that allows the client to obtain a list of active nodes in the cluster and update its connection pool accordingly. This helps to ensure that requests are evenly distributed among the nodes and that the client is able to adapt to changes in the cluster. The text also provides information about two sniffing options: sniffing at startup and sniffing on connection failure. Sniffing at startup will execute a sniff request one time only during the client initialization or first usage, while sniffing on connection failure will execute a sniff request every time a node is faulty. Tracardi has some configuration that can be adopted to turn on or off sniffing. Finally, the text provides a link to more information on how to configure sniffing.
