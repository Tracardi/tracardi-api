Object templates are used to reshape data into any object you want. An example of an object template is provided in the documentation, which references data with dot notation. When dot notation is used, the data referenced is replaced with the data from the profile and event. An example of using an object template with sample data from profile and event is also provided. Additionally, the documentation provides links to related topics such as templates, dot notation, logic notation, and make payload plugin.
