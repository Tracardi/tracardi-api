Tracardi microservice plugin is a new way to extend Tracardi without system upgrade. It allows users to access a continuously growing set of services and eliminates the need for maintenance costs. To use the Tracardi microservice plugin, users must provide an API KEY. This API KEY must be at least 32 characters long and must be a random value that is hard to guess. Once the API KEY is provided, users can select one of the available services that are installed on the microservice server. Depending on the selected service, additional forms may need to be filled out with the credentials that are required for the service to work. If the developer provided the documentation for the microservice, users should see a manual with tips on how to configure the selected service. Once the service is configured, plugins can be found in the workflow editor. These plugins will connect to the microservice and run the configured action.
