This documentation outlines the event "Profile Archived" which should be used when a customer's profile is archived, meaning their account is deactivated or deleted from the system, or the maximum time to live is reached. This event is used to track when a customer's profile is archived and to perform any necessary actions, such as removing the customer's personal information from the company's records. The event can be triggered either manually, when a customer decides to delete their account, or automatically, when the system archives old or unused profiles. No properties are defined for this event.
