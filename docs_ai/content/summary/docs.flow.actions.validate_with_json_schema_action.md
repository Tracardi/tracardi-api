This plugin is used to validate objects using a provided JSON schema. It takes any payload as input and returns the payload on the **TRUE** port if the validation is passed, or the payload on the **FALSE** port if the validation fails. If the schema is incorrect, then the **ERROR** port is triggered. The JSON configuration for the plugin requires a **validation_schema** field, which should contain a valid JSON object. Examples of valid schemas are provided in the documentation. The schema should include a title, description, type, properties, and required fields.
