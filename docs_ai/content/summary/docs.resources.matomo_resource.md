This documentation provides information on how to connect to Matomo, a web analytics platform, by providing an API address and a token. The token acts as a password and should be kept secret. Each Matomo user has a different token. The API address is the URL where the Matomo API is installed. 

To generate a token_auth, users must be logged in to the Matomo server and follow the steps outlined in the documentation. For Matomo 4 and newer, users must log in, go to the Matomo Admin, click on Personal -> Security, click on "Create new token", confirm their account password, enter a description for the purpose of the plugin, and click on "Create new token". For Matomo 3 and older, users must log in, click on Administration in the top menu, and click the link “API” in the left menu. The token_auth value can be re-generated on request by any user under Administration > Personal Settings.

To find the Site ID, users must log into their Matomo account, go to Administration, click on Measurables (or Websites) > Manage, and the website ID will be listed on the left of the table. If users are using Matomo for WordPress, the Site ID should be 1 and can be double-checked in Matomo Analytics > System Report > Matomo Blog idSite.
