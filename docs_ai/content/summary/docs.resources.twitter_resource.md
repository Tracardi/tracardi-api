This documentation provides instructions on how to set up a Twitter application and generate API keys. First, users must go to the Twitter app page and create a new app. Then, they must change their access level from Essential to Elevated. After that, they must change their User authentication settings and provide information about why they need elevated access. Finally, they must generate their API keys by expanding their project and app, selecting the Keys and tokens tab, and clicking the Generate button in the Consumer Keys and Authentication Tokens sections. Once they have generated their API keys, they must copy them to the Tracardi form.
