This documentation describes a plugin that generates passwords according to user input. The user can customize the password specification by setting five properties: maximum length, minimum length, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and special characters. An example of the configuration is provided in the form of a JSON object. The object includes the minimum and maximum length of the password, as well as the number of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and special characters that should be included in the password. The plugin will then generate a password that meets the user's specifications. 

The plugin is designed to provide users with a secure and easy way to generate passwords. It allows users to customize the password to their own preferences, ensuring that the password is both secure and easy to remember. Additionally, the plugin is designed to be easy to use, allowing users to quickly generate passwords without having to manually enter each character. This makes it an ideal solution for users who need to generate secure passwords quickly and easily.
