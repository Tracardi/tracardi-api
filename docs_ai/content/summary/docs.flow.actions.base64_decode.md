This plugin is designed to decode a base64-encoded string to its plain text form. It requires configuration, which includes providing a path to the string that needs to be transformed and setting the encoding of the output string. The input payload is read from a property in the input payload. The output of this plugin is an object with the input property decoded from a base64 string. An example of the output is a JSON object with a "text" property containing the plain text string.
