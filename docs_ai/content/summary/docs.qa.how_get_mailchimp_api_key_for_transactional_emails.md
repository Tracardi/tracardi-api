This documentation provides instructions on how to obtain an API key for sending transactional emails with Mailchimp through the Mandrill service. The process begins by logging into the Mailchimp account and selecting the "Profile" option from the account icon in the top-right corner. From there, the user should select "Extras" and then "API keys" to access the "Your API keys" section. The user should then click on "Add a Mandrill API Key" and follow the instructions on the Mandrill site to set up the sending domain and verify ownership. Once the domain verification is complete, the API key will be available on the Mandrill site. The user should copy the API key and use it for sending transactional emails, such as with the Tracardi Form. It is important to note that verifying the domain and making changes to the DNS records may be necessary in order to send one-to-one emails successfully. If the domain verification process is not completed, emails sent from Tracardi may be rejected with the error message "unsigned".
