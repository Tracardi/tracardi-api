This plugin is designed to publish payloads to RabbitMQ. It requires configuration, which includes defining a RabbitMQ resource in Tracardi, as well as a queue name and routing key. The input payload is read by the node, and no output is produced. An example configuration is provided in the documentation, which includes a resource ID, queue name, and routing key. This plugin is designed to be used in conjunction with other nodes in the Tracardi system to facilitate the transfer of data between different services.
