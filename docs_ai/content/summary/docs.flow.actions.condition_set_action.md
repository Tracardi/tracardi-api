The Check Conditions plugin is a tool that allows users to evaluate conditions and return results with the resolved condition set. It takes key-value pairs as input, where the value is a condition and the key is a string. For example, the key "marketing-consent" could have the value "profile@consents.marketing EXISTS". This plugin takes any type of payload as input and outputs an object with conditions evaluated to either false or true. For example, the output could be {"marketing-consent": true, "is-it-raining": false}. This plugin is useful for evaluating conditions and returning results with the resolved condition set.
