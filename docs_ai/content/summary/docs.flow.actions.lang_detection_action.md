This Language Detection Plugin is used to detect the language of a given string using the MeaningCloud API. In order to use this plugin, the user must have an account with MeaningCloud and configure the plugin with the access token. The configuration requires the user to enter the source ID, the message to be analyzed, and the timeout for the response. The resource configuration requires the user to enter the token, which can be obtained by registering at the MeaningCloud website. This plugin does not process input payloads, and returns a JSON with the API response at the response port if the API call is successful. An example of a successful call is provided, which includes the deepTime, language_list, status, and time.
