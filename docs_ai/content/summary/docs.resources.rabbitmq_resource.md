RabbitMQ is a messaging broker that allows for the processing of compute intensive data outside of the tracardi server. It is possible to run data processing in the background and distribute the load to multiple servers. To access the RabbitMQ broker, a new user must be created with a port number, virtual host name, and connection timeout limit. This resource can be used as a destination for data processing. For more information about RabbitMQ, visit the official documentation page.
