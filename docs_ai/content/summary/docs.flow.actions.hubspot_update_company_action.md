This plugin allows users to update a company from HubSpot, based on provided data. It takes any payload as input and returns response from HubSpot API on port **response**, or optional error info on port **error** if one occurs. In order to use this plugin, users must first create an app in their HubSpot account. This can be done by logging in to hubspot.com, selecting their account, navigating to settings, account setup, integrations, and private app. When creating the app, users must choose the appropriate scopes, such as crm.objects.companies.write, crm.objects.companies.read, crm.objects.contacts.write, crm.schemas.contacts.read, and content. Once the app is created, users can access the access token for the app. 

The plugin can be configured either with a form or with a JSON configuration. When using the form, users must provide their HubSpot resource, access token, company id, and properties. When using the JSON configuration, users must provide their access token, company id, and properties. The properties must include a company name and description. Once the plugin is configured, users can update their company from HubSpot.
