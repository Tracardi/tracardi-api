This plugin allows users to load a profile into the workflow and assign it to the current event. The user must select a field that will be used to identify the profile, such as an e-mail address. Additionally, a field value is required to load the profile, which can be a static value or referenced from the event or any object inside the workflow. The default values configure the plugin to use the event property email and profile pii.email to match the profile. If the profile is found, it will be replaced inside the workflow and the current event will have the profile replaced with the loaded one. On success, the profile port is triggered with the loaded profile object. On failure, the error port is triggered with the error message.

The plugin also allows for advanced JSON configuration. The field is a field name and the value is a value of that field. An example of this configuration is provided in the documentation. This plugin provides a useful way to quickly and easily load a profile into the workflow and assign it to the current event.
