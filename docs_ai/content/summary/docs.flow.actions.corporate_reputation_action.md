This plugin is designed to analyze text for opinions about companies using MeaningCloud's Corporate reputation API. It takes any payload as input and returns response from API on port **response**, or optional error info on **error** port if one occurs. The plugin configuration requires the user to select their MeaningCloud resource, containing their MeaningCloud API token, as well as provide the path to the text they want to analyze, the language of the text (**es**, **en**) or leave it as **auto** for automatic language detection, and optionally provide a name of company for API to focus on when analyzing the text. Additionally, the user can filter their results by company type according to MeaningCloud's ontology, and enable relaxed typography to make the API less strict in terms of spelling and mistakes. Advanced configuration requires the user to provide the name and ID of their MeaningCloud resource, the path to the text to analyze, the language of the text, the name of the company to focus on, the type of company to filter with, and a boolean value for relaxed typography.
