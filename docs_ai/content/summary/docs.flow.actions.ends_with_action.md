This documentation describes the EndsWith Plugin, which is used to check if a data field ends with a defined prefix. The plugin is configured using a JSON configuration, which is provided as an example in the documentation. The example input includes a "field" and a "prefix" parameter, which are used to define the data field and the prefix to be checked. The plugin will output the payload on the TRUE port if the field contains the prefix, or on the FALSE port if it does not.
