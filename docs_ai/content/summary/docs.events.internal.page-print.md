This documentation provides information about the 'Page Print' event, which should be used when a customer prints a page. It can be useful to track how many users are printing pages and which pages are being printed most frequently. An example of this event being used is when a user prints a product page on an e-commerce website to show the product information to a friend. 

The documentation also provides information about the expected properties of the event, which are all optional. If any property is missing, it will not be processed and no error will be reported. The table provided lists the name and expected type of each property, as well as an example. 

The documentation also provides information about auto indexing, which helps to make data easy to find by creating a structure that organizes the data. This structure is made by copying information from the different parts of the data and putting it into a specific format that can be used to analyze and group the data. The table provided lists which event property will be copied to event traits. 

Finally, the documentation states that data will not be copied to profile, and provides a JSON example of the event.
