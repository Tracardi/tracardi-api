The Sort Dictionary plugin is used to sort a dictionary and return it as a list of tuples of key and value. The dictionary is provided as a path to data in the event, and the order is provided by the direction (default: "asc"). The plugin does not process input, and returns the ordered list of tuples with keys and values. An example of the configuration is provided, as well as an example of the output. The configuration includes the data, direction, and sort_by parameters. The data parameter is the dictionary to be sorted, the direction parameter is the order of the sorting (ascending or descending), and the sort_by parameter is the criteria for sorting (key or value). The output is a list of tuples with the keys and values of the sorted dictionary.
