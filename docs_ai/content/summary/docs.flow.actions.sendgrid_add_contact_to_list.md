This plugin allows users to send bulk emails via Sendgrid API. To use this plugin, users must have a Sendgrid account and generate an API key. Additionally, users must configure their domain in Sendgrid settings. Depending on the Sendgrid plan, users may be restricted to sending emails only within their own domain. The plugin takes any payload as input and returns a response from Sendgrid API. If the response is successful, it will trigger the payload port, otherwise it will trigger an error. The plugin's configuration requires information about the API key, sender email, message recipient's email(s), message subject and message content. The Sendgrid token must be stored in Tracardi's resources and users must provide both test and production API key (token). The API token can be found in the settings -> SMTP & API Info section of the Sendgrid account.
