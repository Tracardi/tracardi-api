This documentation describes a plugin that connects to a MongoDB database and queries it. It includes a configuration section that specifies the source, database, collection, and query. The source is identified by a name and an ID, and the query is written in JSON format. The plugin does not process input payload, and the output is the result of the query. This plugin can be used to access data stored in a MongoDB database and use it in a workflow.
