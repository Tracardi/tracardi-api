This documentation provides instructions on how to set up a workflow to segment profiles based on the number of visits made to them. It explains that an "if" condition should be used to check the number of visits made to the profile, and that within the "if" condition, the "add segment" action should be connected to the TRUE port to add the desired segment to the profile. It also provides an example of how the workflow could be structured, and explains that the profile's visit count is stored in `metadata.time.visit.count` and is automatically increased with every visit. This information can be used to create a workflow that segments profiles based on the number of visits made to them.
