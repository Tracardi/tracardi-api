The Segment Profile Action documentation explains how Tracardi uses customer segmentation to divide customers into groups that reflect similarity among them. This is done by using conditions that define how customer data gets assigned to the segment group. The workflow must trigger this procedure, however, if the profile is updated it will automatically trigger user segmentation. If for some reason manual segmentation is desired, the node must be connected in the workflow. This node does not require any configuration or input data and does not return any data. Additionally, segmentation does not have any side effects.
