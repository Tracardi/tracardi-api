The documentation text describes the Raise Event Action, which is a feature of the TRACARDI platform. This action triggers a defined event type, which can be intercepted by TRACARDI to run a defined flow. The action can also send defined event properties. In order to configure the action, the user must profile the event type and event properties that will be attached to the event and then sent to TRACARDI. The user can also set properties from the payload, by starting with @ and giving a path (in dot notation) to the JSON data. Debugging of flows with raised events can be tricky, as the user will only see data from one flow, and not from other triggered flows. Additionally, the user must be aware of the possibility of cyclic flows, which can form a never-ending cycle if not prevented. TRACARDI will stop sending new events when it detects a possible cyclic execution.
