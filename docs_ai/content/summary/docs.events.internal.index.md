Tracardi 0.8.1 provides a set of internal events that can be used to track customer journey on your website or application. These events come with default properties that can be used to collect data without the need for manual copying. This simplifies the use of Tracardi and allows for better analytics. When an internal event is used, the system automatically detects it and fills up the profile and session with appropriate data.

The internal events provided by Tracardi 0.8.1 include Page View, Search, Signup, Identification, Purchase Order, and Cart Update. Each event captures different data, such as the URL of the page visited, the search query and category, customer's first name, last name, email address, login information, product ID, name, price, and quantity. Using these events helps you understand your customers' behavior and preferences, allowing you to optimize your website or application for better engagement and conversions. If the default event does not expect the data that you want to send, you can still send the data and copy it manually. Other defined properties will be copied automatically, and the missing ones will be saved in the event and can be moved to the profile manually.
