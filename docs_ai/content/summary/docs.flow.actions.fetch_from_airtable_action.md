This plugin is designed to fetch data from an Airtable table, according to a provided query. It takes any payload as input and returns records on the port 'response' if everything is OK, or some error info on the port 'error' if one occurs. The configuration for this plugin requires the user to provide an Airtable resource containing an API key, the ID of the Airtable base, the name of the table in the given base, and an optional query formula. The query formula supports dot templates, and an example of this is '{profileID} = {{profile@id}}', which will match every record where the value of the 'profileID' field is equal to the current 'profile@id' value. The configuration for this plugin can also be provided in JSON format.
