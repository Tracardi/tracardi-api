The Tracardi system allows for the segmentation of customer profiles into smaller groups with similar characteristics. This is done by defining criteria for segmentation in the segmentation tab. Criteria are logical rules that are used to determine which profiles belong to which segment. For example, a segment named "Frequent Visitor" might have a criterion that states that a profile must have visited the website at least 10 times. If the profile meets this criterion, then the segmentation id will be added to the profile in the segments item. A profile can belong to multiple segments. 

The segmentation process can be initiated manually within a workflow by placing the action "Segment profile" or it can be started automatically after each update of profile data. The segmentation process is important for targeting specific marketing campaigns or other customer-centric actions based on customer behavior and characteristics. It is also useful for understanding customer behavior and preferences in order to better serve them.
