This documentation provides information on how to configure and set up a GitHub resource. It explains that in order to add a GitHub resource, a Personal Access Token (PAT) needs to be added. The PAT is linked to the user's GitHub account and can be generated by following the instructions provided in the link. Additionally, the documentation provides two parameters that need to be configured: the API URL, which usually does not need to be changed and can be left at the default value of https://api.github.com, and the personal access token. For more information, the documentation provides a link to the Github documentation on personal tokens.
