This plugin allows users to call the Zapier webhook API. The configuration requires a Zapier webhook URL, which is provided in the form of a JSON object. The payload for this plugin defines a JSON data to be sent, which can be any JSON schema. The plugin returns either the response on the response port or an error on the error port. A valid response is a JSON object with a status of 200 and a content field containing the response as a JSON object.
