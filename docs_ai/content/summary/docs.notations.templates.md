The documentation explains that templates are text files with special mark-up. The mark-up is used to reference data from the internal state of the workflow. This is done by using double curly braces and dot notation. The dot notation reads data from the internal state of the workflow and replaces the mark-up with the data. The documentation also provides links to related topics such as object template, dot notation, logic notation, and make payload plugin.
