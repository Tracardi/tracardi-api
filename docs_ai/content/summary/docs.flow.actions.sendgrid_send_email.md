This plugin allows users to send bulk emails via the Sendgrid API. In order to use this plugin, users must have a Sendgrid account and generate an API key. Additionally, users must configure their domain in the Sendgrid settings. Depending on the Sendgrid plan, users may be restricted to sending emails only within their own domain. 

The plugin takes any payload as input and returns a response from the Sendgrid API. Depending on the response result, the plugin will trigger either the payload port (if the response is successful) or an error port (if the response indicates that the email was not sent). The plugin's configuration requires information about the API key, sender email, message recipient's email(s), message subject, and message content. The sender email must end with one of the domains registered in Sendgrid. The message recipient's email can be in the form of a dot path to the email address or the address itself. The message content can be in HTML or plain text format and can include templates. 

On the Sendgrid site, users can turn on the test mode after clicking on their username in the upper right corner. In the test mode, users can generate a test API key which can be used in Tracardi for test purposes. Messages won't be sent, but Sendgrid will act like they are, so users can test their configuration without being charged.
