This documentation provides instructions on how to install and test the commercial version of Tracardi using docker-compose. It is important to note that this installation is not intended for production use, but rather for testing purposes only. The first step is to login to docker hub with the provided credentials. After logging in, the user must create a file called .env-docker and paste the license into it. Depending on the operating system, the user may need to set the environment variables and source the .env-docker file. Finally, the user must run the com-docker-compose.yaml as the docker compose file. Following these steps will allow the user to install and test the commercial version of Tracardi.
