The Tracardi Customer Data Platform is an open-source platform that provides businesses with a low-code/no-code solution
for managing customer data. It is an API-first platform that can be easily integrated into existing systems, allowing
businesses to ingest, aggregate, and store customer data from multiple sources in real-time.

Tracardi also provides tools for managing and modeling customer data, including the ability to define rules that shape
the data as it is delivered and copied into user profiles. This allows businesses to segment customers into custom
groups and target them more effectively. Additionally, Tracardi can be used to personalize the user experience through
real-time customer segmentation and targeting, improving the overall customer experience.

Tracardi also provides tools for unifying customer data from various sources into a single profile, including the
ability to de-duplicate customer records and blend multiple customer accounts into a single unified profile. This makes
it easier for businesses to manage and understand their customer data. Finally, Tracardi is a powerful framework for
creating marketing automation apps, enabling businesses to easily send data to other systems and automate various
processes.
