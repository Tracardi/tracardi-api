The documentation text provides best practises for configuring a system or application. The first best practise is to
set a strong admin password. This is important for systems that handle sensitive or confidential data, as it can help to
prevent unauthorized access and protect the security and integrity of the system or application. The second best
practise is to separate the track server and API. This can help to ensure that the track server and API are running
independently, and that the track server is not affected by changes to the API. The third best practise is to run
workers. This can help to ensure that the system or application is running efficiently and reliably, and that tasks are
completed in a timely manner.
