This documentation provides information about Google Analytics, a web analytics service offered by Google. It explains the two versions of Google Analytics, the latest one being Google Analytics 4, and that Google Universal Analytics will become obsolete in 2023. It also provides instructions on how to find the Google Universal Analytics ID, which is necessary for the Tracardi Resource Form. The instructions include opening Google Analytics, clicking the ‘Admin’ tab, clicking Tracking Info, clicking ‘Tracking Code’, and copying the code that starts with “UA.” This code should then be pasted into the Tracardi Resource Form.
