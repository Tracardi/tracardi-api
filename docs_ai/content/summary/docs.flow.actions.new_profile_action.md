This documentation describes a plugin that is used to determine if a customer has created a new profile when they visit a website. The plugin will return a payload on the TRUE port if the event has created a new profile, which usually happens when the customer visits the site for the first time. The output of the plugin will be a payload on either the TRUE or FALSE port, depending on whether or not the profile was just created. This plugin can be used to help track customer activity and ensure that new customers are properly identified.
