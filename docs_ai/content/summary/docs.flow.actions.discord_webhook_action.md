This plugin is used to send messages to a Discord channel. To configure the plugin, a Discord webhook URL must be obtained. This can be done by going to the settings of the channel that the message should be sent to, clicking on integrations, expanding the webhook list, and clicking on new webhook. The URL should then be copied to the URL field in the configuration JSON. The configuration JSON also includes a timeout, a message, and a username. This plugin does not process input payloads, and returns either the input payload on the response port or an error on the error port.
