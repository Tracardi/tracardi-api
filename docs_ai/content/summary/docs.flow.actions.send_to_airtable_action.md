This plugin allows users to send data to an Airtable table. It takes any payload as input and returns record data on port response if everything is OK, or some error info on port error if one occurs. The user must configure the plugin with a form or advanced configuration. The Airtable resource must be selected, containing the API key. The Base ID must be pasted in, which can be found while inspecting the base in Airtable. The Table name must be typed in, and Record mapping must be provided with key-value pairs. The key is the name of the field in the table for the new record, and the value is the path to the value of this field, or the value itself. Advanced configuration requires a JSON object with the source ID and name, the base ID, the table name, and the mapping of field names and values.
