This plugin sends data to an InfluxDB database. It takes any payload as input and returns the given payload on the port **success** if everything went OK, or on the port **error** if an error occurred. Data in InfluxDB is more complex than regular data, and is organized into an Organization, Bucket, Measure, Fields, Values, and Time. The configuration for this plugin requires the user to provide an InfluxDB resource, organization, bucket, fields, measurement name, time, and record tags. Advanced configuration requires the user to provide a source name and ID, bucket, fields, measurement, time, tags, and organization. It is important to note that the InfluxDB API does not always return information about errors when trying to insert incorrect data, which can cause the plugin to trigger the **success** port even if the data has not been inserted. However, with some major errors, the **error** port is triggered properly.
