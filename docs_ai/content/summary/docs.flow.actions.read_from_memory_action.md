This plugin allows users to read from cross-instance Tracardi user memory, using a given key. In order for this plugin to work, a Redis database must be installed and running. This plugin takes any payload as input and returns a value on the success port if the value was successfully read from the memory, or an error detail on the error port if an error occurred. The output on the success port is an example of a JSON object with a "value" key, and the output on the error port is an example of a JSON object with a "detail" key. 

The configuration for this plugin requires a key, which is the name of the variable that holds saved data. If the key is missing, it will return a null value on the success port. Advanced configuration requires a JSON object with a "key" key, which is the key to the value in memory.
