The Log Message plugin is a useful tool for logging messages to flow logs. It takes any payload as input and returns the same payload on the port "payload" without any changes. The plugin also requires a configuration in the form of a JSON object. This object must include two fields: "type" and "message". The "type" field must be set to either "warning", "info", or "error" and the "message" field must be set to a string of the user's choice. This plugin is useful for logging messages to flow logs in order to keep track of the flow of data and any errors that may occur.
