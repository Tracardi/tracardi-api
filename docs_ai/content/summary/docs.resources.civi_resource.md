This documentation provides information on how to configure and set up the CiviCRM resource. CiviCRM is a web-based suite of internationalized open-source software for constituency relationship management. It is designed to manage information about an organization's donors, members, event registrants, subscribers, grant-application seekers and funders, and case contacts. 

In order to set up the resource, three pieces of information are needed: an API key, a Site key, and an API URL. The API key is unique to CiviCRM contacts and should be added to the contact, granting appropriate permissions. The Site key can be found in the __civicrm.settings.php__ file on the server. It should look something like: ```php if (!defined('CIVICRM_SITE_KEY')) { define( 'CIVICRM_SITE_KEY', 'qwednKcpN93x0mvv'); }``` In this case, the Site key is __qwednKcpN93x0mvv__. The API URL should provide the host of the CiviCRM instance, extended by __/sites/all/modules/civicrm/extern/rest.php__, or the location of the __rest.php__ file if it has been moved.
