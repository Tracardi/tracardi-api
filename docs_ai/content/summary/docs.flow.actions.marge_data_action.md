This plugin is a great tool for combining data from two different sources. It allows us to add a new set of data to an existing one, or to combine profile and event data. The plugin requires us to indicate the source data and the data that we want to combine. The source data is in the form of reference and the data that we want to add is passed in the form of an object. The object can be a schema with references to workflow data. The output of this plugin is the combined output of the plugin. We can choose between two methods of combining the data - override and merge. The override method will overwrite data in case of data conflict, while the merge method will combine data in case of conflict in array of all data. For example, if there are different values for the same field, e.g. for the name field, one is "Bill", the second time it is "William", then the data will be combined and we will get a value name = ["Bill", "William"] if merge method is selected. This plugin is a great tool for combining data from two different sources and can be very useful in many situations.
