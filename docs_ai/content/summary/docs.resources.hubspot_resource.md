This documentation provides instructions on how to obtain an API Key from HubSpot's dashboard. It explains that users must first log in to HubSpot as a regular user, then go to Settings, find Account Setup, Integrations, and Private Apps, and click it. After clicking "Create Private App", users must fill in the name and description in the Basic Info tab, and set the scope/permission for any actions they want to do in the Scopes tab. The documentation then provides a list of suggested scopes for the Tracardi plugins to work. After clicking "Create app", users must click "Show token" and copy the token, which they can then paste into the Token field in the Tracardi form.
