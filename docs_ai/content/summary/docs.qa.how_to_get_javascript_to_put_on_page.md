After providing a suitable name and channel name, the newly created event source will be listed among the existing sources. The next step is to click on the newly created event source from the list, which will open a detailed information about that specific source. Inside the "Use and Javascript" tab, you will find a detailed description guiding you on how to utilize the JavaScript snippet for integration. In case of any issues, it is recommended to refer to the documentation provided and search for "JavaScript integration" for comprehensive resources and support materials.
