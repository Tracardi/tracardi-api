This plugin is designed to split a given string into an array of values using a given delimiter. The configuration for the plugin requires two parameters: a string and a delimiter. The string can be provided as a path to data in profile, event, session, etc. The delimiter is the character used to separate the string into an array of values. For example, if the string is "a.b.c" and the delimiter is ".", the plugin will return an array of ["a", "b", "c"]. The plugin does not process any input and returns an array with the separated values. An example of the output is a JSON object with a "result" key containing the array of values.
