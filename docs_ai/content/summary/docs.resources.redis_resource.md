This documentation provides information about Redis, an open source, in-memory data structure store. It is used as a database, cache, and message broker, and its in-memory data structures enable building data infrastructure for real-time applications that require low latency and high-throughput. 

In order to connect to Redis, the user needs to have the following information: the URL of the Redis database, the username, and the password. All of these pieces of information are required and none can be left empty. This documentation provides the user with the necessary information to set up and configure their Redis resource.
