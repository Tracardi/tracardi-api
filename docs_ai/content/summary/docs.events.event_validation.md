This documentation provides information about event validation in Tracardi. Event validation can be configured in the Tracardi GUI or via the API. The endpoints responsible for creating the validation schemes are located at the following endpoints: GET /event/management, DELETE /event/management/{event_type}, and GET /event/management. To add a new event validation schema, a Json Schema object must be provided that defines the model of event, event session, or loaded profile. The validator consists of two elements: data to be validated, expressed in a dotted notation, and the json schema itself. Validation is cached and the default Time To Live for cache is 180 seconds. If the validations do not pass, an error 406 - NOT ACCEPTABLE status is returned with the information on the reason why the validation did not pass. The complete API documentation is available at http://tracardi-host:8686/docs.
