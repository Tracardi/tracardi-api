## Event sources

In order to start collecting data Tracardi needs an event source. The source can be defined in Tracardi. It will give
you an identifier which when attached to your track calls will open Tracardi to sent data.

The source that can emit events, e.g. web page, event scheduler, SMS gateway, payload from the queue. This type of
sources can send data to Tracardi every time something happens.
