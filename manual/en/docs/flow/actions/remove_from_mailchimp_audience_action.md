# Remove from MailChimp audience plugin
This plugin removes contact from your MailChimp audience based on provided data.
## Requirements
Before using this plugin, you need to create MailChimp account, generate marketing API key and 
add MailChimp to resources.
## Input
This plugin takes payload - any JSON-like object.
## Outputs
Plugin returns MailChimp API response on **response** port if action was successful, or
an error from MailChimp API on port **error** if one occurs.
## Config
#### Config with form
- MailChimp resource - here select your MailChimp marketing resource with API key.
- ID of your list (audience) - it's your audience's ID, that you can easily check on MailChimp website.
- Contact's email address - that's path to email address of your contact. Notice that field can contain multiple values,
therefore if profile after merging has two email addresses, then plugin will add two contacts to your audience.

or permanently deleted, with no way of recreating and no data left (at least without their consent).
